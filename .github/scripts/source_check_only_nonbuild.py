"""Decide whether the container-source SHA check is relevant to this PR.

The ``Check {Agent,UI} Container Source`` gates compare the git tree SHA of
``services/agent`` / ``services/ui`` against the ``com.nvidia.vss.source_tree_sha``
baked into the deployed image. Because that tree SHA covers the *whole* folder,
once an allowed docs change merges to ``develop`` the folder drifts from the
promoted image — and then the check fails on **every** later PR, even ones that
touch neither the service nor the image tag (it re-evaluates HEAD's drifted
folder). The gate is also a required status check, so it must always run and
report a conclusion; we can't skip it at the workflow trigger or the PR hangs.

So the gate runs the SHA comparison only when the PR could actually affect the
match, i.e. it changed either:

  * a **build-relevant** file under the service folder (anything the image
    build consumes — i.e. not the allowlisted docs/tests/metadata below), or
  * the service's **resolved deployable image tag** (a tag bump in
    ``deploy/docker`` compose/.env).

Otherwise it prints ``true`` (skip — this PR can't have broken the match), so a
predecessor's docs-drift doesn't red-flag unrelated PRs. It prints ``false``
(run the real check) whenever a build-relevant file or this service's tag
changed, on integration-branch pushes, or whenever it is unsure.

The tag comparison is per-service and value-based (resolve the image ref at
HEAD vs the merge-base), so a UI tag bump in a shared ``.env`` does not trip the
agent gate and vice-versa.

Output: a single ``true``/``false`` token on stdout. Diagnostics go to stderr.
