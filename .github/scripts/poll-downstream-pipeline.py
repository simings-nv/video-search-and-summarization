"""Poll a downstream CI pipeline and report per-job progress.

Runs inline right after ``trigger_downstream_pipeline.py`` in the same
GitHub Actions job. Reads the pipeline / project ids from env (set by
the trigger step via ``$GITHUB_OUTPUT``), then polls the downstream
API every ``POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS`` (default 120s) until the pipeline
reaches a terminal state.

Reporting rules (printed once per job, no duplicates):

* ``SUCCESS: <job name>`` when a job transitions to status ``success``.
* ``SKIPPED: <job name>`` when a job opted out of running via the
  conventional gate-skip exit code (``exit_code: 75``) while configured
  with ``allow_failure: true``. The downstream API still records the
  job as ``failed`` in that case, but our convention is to treat
  ``exit_code == 75`` as a deliberate skip.
* ``ALLOWED_FAILURE: <job name>`` when a job fails with any other exit
  code while still configured with ``allow_failure: true``.
* ``FAIL: <job name>`` when any non-``allow_failure`` job reaches status
  ``failed`` - the script exits 1 immediately.
* ``CANCELED: <job name>`` when a job is canceled - the script exits 1
  immediately.

Resolving the exit code is non-trivial: many downstream API versions
do NOT include ``exit_code`` in either the pipeline-jobs listing or
the per-job detail endpoint, so we fall back to fetching the job's
text trace and parsing the runner's terminal
``ERROR: Job failed: exit code <N>`` line. Resolution per job id is
cached for the lifetime of the poller.

Exit codes:

* ``0`` - pipeline finished with no failures.
* ``1`` - a failing / canceled job was observed, or the poller timed
  out (see ``MAX_POLL_DURATION_SECONDS``).

Retried jobs are handled by de-duping on ``name`` and keeping only
the latest attempt (highest ``id``).
