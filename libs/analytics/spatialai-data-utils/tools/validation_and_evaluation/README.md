# Validation and Evaluation

Validates generated MTMC data from object storage and, in full mode, evaluates Sparse4D
detection output with BEV-sensor-specific metrics.

Sparse4D produces 3D detections for a set of camera sensors. In this tool, a
camera group is evaluated as a Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) sensor, so detection
metrics are written per BEV sensor group and then combined into one summary CSV.

Detection evaluation reports mean Average Precision (mAP) and the per-class
true-positive error metrics used by the bundled nuScenes-style evaluator.

## Requirements

> **Requires the `eval` extra.** Detection evaluation uses the bundled
> nuScenes-style evaluator (`spatialai_data_utils.eval.*`), which imports the
> nuScenes dev-kit: `pip install 'spatialai-data-utils[eval]'`. Note
> `nuscenes-devkit` pulls OpenCV transitively (which ships with bundled
> `ffmpeg` libraries and codecs) — review their licenses and terms of
> distribution and use before installing.
>
> **Docker image and video visualization:** [`docker/Dockerfile`](../../docker/Dockerfile)
> replaces the standard OpenCV wheel with a custom build compiled without
> FFmpeg, GStreamer, or their codecs. Evaluation and image-based visualization
> work in this image, but OpenCV video reading and writing do not. For video
> visualization, use a clean environment with
> `pip install "spatialai-data-utils[viz]"`, which pulls OpenCV with bundled
> FFmpeg libraries and codecs; review their licenses and terms of distribution
> and use before proceeding.

Inputs are expected to be in NVSchema line-delimited JSON format:

- `calibration.json`: calibration data with camera sensors and BEV group
  membership.
- `ground-truth/`: required for full validation and evaluation.
- `mdx-bev/`: Sparse4D BEV detection output.

Representative `mdx-bev` record:

```json
{
  "version": "3.0",
  "id": "15",
  "timestamp": "2024-12-20T18:15:28.067986Z",
  "sensorId": "mdx-bev-region-1",
  "objects": [
    {
      "id": "0",
      "type": "Person",
      "confidence": 0.9597891,
      "coordinate": {"x": 1.703, "y": -4.07, "z": 0.846},
      "bbox3d": {
        "coordinates": [1.703, -4.07, 0.846, 0.535, 0.328, 1.704, 0.0, 0.0, 0.029],
        "confidence": 0.9597891
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Environment

Configure the existing `tools/validation_and_evaluation/.env` file:

```env
HOST_IP=localhost

STORAGE_PROVIDER="aws"  # aws or gcs

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
AWS_REGION=<AWS_REGION>
AWS_BUCKET=<AWS_BUCKET_NAME>

GCS_HMAC_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<GCS_HMAC_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
GCS_HMAC_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<GCS_HMAC_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
GCS_BUCKET=<GCS_BUCKET_NAME>
GCS_ENDPOINT_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com

BASE_PREFIX_PATH=generated/
SIMULATION_ID=<SIMULATION_ID>
```

The tool downloads into `results/<SIMULATION_ID>/`.

`BASE_PREFIX_PATH` must be the object-storage prefix before `SIMULATION_ID`.
For example, if objects are under
`s3://<bucket>/generated/<SIMULATION_ID>/ground-truth/`, set:

```env
BASE_PREFIX_PATH="generated/"
```

## Docker Usage

Build the image from the repository root if needed:

```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t spatialai_data_utils .
```

Run the validation and evaluation flow from the repository root. Mount the env file explicitly so a different simulation can be used without replacing `tools/validation_and_evaluation/.env`:

```bash
# Create a results directory with necessary permissions
mkdir -p "$(pwd)/results"
sudo chown -R "$USER:$USER" "$(pwd)/results"

# Launch Docker with the validation tool, env file, and results directory mounted
docker run --rm -it --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  -v "$(pwd)/tools/validation_and_evaluation:/workspace/tools/validation_and_evaluation" \
  -v "$(pwd)/tools/validation_and_evaluation/.env:/workspace/tools/validation_and_evaluation/.env:ro" \
  -v "$(pwd)/results:/workspace/results" \
  -w /workspace \
  spatialai_data_utils \
  python tools/validation_and_evaluation/run_validation_and_evaluation.py \
    --calibration_url <calibration-URL>
```

Local outputs are written to `results/<SIMULATION_ID>/` on the host because
`results/` is bind-mounted.

## Data Validation Checks

Full mode performs validation before and after download:

- Object-storage ground-truth count: checks
  `<BASE_PREFIX_PATH><SIMULATION_ID>/ground-truth/mega_gt` before
  downloading. It errors below
  `simulation_seconds * fps * ground_truth_record_count_error_threshold_ratio`
  and warns below
  `simulation_seconds * fps * ground_truth_record_count_warning_threshold_ratio`.
- Object-storage bin-file validation: checks sensor bridge bin directories under
  `ground-truth/` unless `--skip_bin_files_check` is set.
- Ground-truth file validation: checks non-empty content, synchronized sensor
  timestamps, known calibration sensors, expected record count, and non-empty
  object `type` values.
- BEV file validation: checks non-empty `mdx-bev`, BEV delay relative to ground
  truth, BEV record count thresholds, intra-record sensor timestamp spread, and
  inter-record spacing.

BEV-only mode performs a smaller flow:

- Downloads only `mdx-bev/`.
- Skips ground-truth validation and detection evaluation.
- Runs the BEV file validation checks that do not require ground truth.

## Full Validation And Evaluation

```bash
python tools/validation_and_evaluation/run_validation_and_evaluation.py \
    --calibration_url s3://<bucket>/generated/<SIMULATION_ID>/calibration.json \
    --confidence_threshold 0.3 \
    --simulation_seconds 120
```

Full mode:

- Downloads and merges `ground-truth/`, `mdx-bev/`, and related datasets.
- Downloads `calibration.json`.
- Checks the object-storage ground-truth record count before downloading/evaluating.
- Validates ground-truth data and BEV data.
- Optionally checks object-storage bin files unless `--skip_bin_files_check` is set.
- Splits GT and prediction data by BEV sensor and runs detection evaluation.
- Writes per-sensor metrics and uploads a combined summary CSV.

## BEV-Only Validation

Use this mode when you only want to validate `mdx-bev` and skip ground-truth
validation/evaluation:

```bash
python tools/validation_and_evaluation/run_validation_and_evaluation.py \
    --calibration_url s3://<bucket>/generated/<SIMULATION_ID>/calibration.json \
    --only_mdx_bev_validation
```

Boolean flags use `action="store_true"`. Pass the flag by itself; do not append
`True` or `False`.

Correct:

```bash
--skip_bin_files_check --only_mdx_bev_validation
```

Incorrect:

```bash
--skip_bin_files_check True --only_mdx_bev_validation True
```

| `--skip_bin_files_check` | `False` | Boolean flag. Skip the object-storage bin-file count check in full mode. |
| `--only_mdx_bev_validation` | `False` | Boolean flag. Validate only `mdx-bev` and skip GT validation/evaluation. |

## Timestamp Checks

`bev_data_validation` performs three BEV timing checks:

- First-record BEV delay: compares the first BEV timestamp with the first GT
  timestamp when a GT file is available. If the actual delay is greater than
  `--bev_delay`, it logs a warning.
- Intra-record sensor synchronization: compares all sensor timestamps inside a
  single BEV record. If the spread is greater than
  `--bev_intra_record_timestamp_tolerance_ms`, it logs a warning and includes
  the number of unsynchronized records in the summary.
- Inter-record spacing: compares consecutive BEV record timestamps against the
  range `[--min_tolerance_ms_for_bev_record, --max_tolerance_ms_for_bev_record]`.
  Records outside the range are counted, warned, and summarized.

Ground-truth timestamp spacing uses the same min/max tolerance range and exits
when the spacing is outside the allowed range.

## Accuracy Metrics

Per-sensor detection outputs include:

- `mAP`: mean Average Precision. With the default `--eval_options location`,
  predictions are matched to ground truth by 2D center distance on the ground
  plane (`DET_CONFIG_CENTER_DISTANCE`); `--eval_options bbox` uses 3D-IoU
  matching (`DET_CONFIG_IOU3D`). AP is computed at the config's single matching
  threshold (currently `0.5`, defined in
  [`configs/eval/detection.py`](../../spatialai_data_utils/configs/eval/detection.py))
  and then averaged across object classes.
- `AP`: Average Precision for one object class.
- `ATE`: Average Translation Error, the 2D center-distance error in meters.
- `ASE`: Average Scale Error, computed as `1 - IoU` after aligning centers and
  orientation.
- `AOE`: Average Orientation Error, the smallest yaw difference in radians.
- `AVE`: Average Velocity Error in meters per second.
- `AAE`: Average Attribute Error, computed as `1 - accuracy`.

The true-positive error metrics are averaged per class at achieved recall levels
above 10%. If a class does not reach 10% recall, its TP errors are set to `1`.

## Outputs

Local outputs are written under:

```text
results/<SIMULATION_ID>/
```

Output files:

```text
results/<SIMULATION_ID>/calibration.json
results/<SIMULATION_ID>/ground-truth/ground-truth-sorted.json
results/<SIMULATION_ID>/mdx-bev/mdx-bev-sorted.json
