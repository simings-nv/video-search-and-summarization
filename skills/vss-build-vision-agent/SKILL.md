  Compose VSS-based agent deployments from a natural-language capability description.
  Use this skill when the user asks for a new VSS profile or extension to an existing
  one (e.g. "create a profile for streaming dense captioning", "add agentic search to
  my base deployment", "integrate my third-party camera system with VSS"). The skill
  reads per-microservice reference files (`integrate-{microservice}.md`,
  `deploy-{microservice}.md`) as ground truth, invents a unique compose-profile flag
  per generation, patches local copies of the relevant upstream service composes
  (never upstream itself), and outputs a validated, self-contained Docker Compose
  deployment under `_builds/{build-name}/` (at the repository root) along with a
  generated per-deployment deploy skill.

# Build Vision Agent

> Source: [NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/video-search-and-summarization](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/video-search-and-summarization)

`build-vision-agent` is the orchestration skill that takes a natural-language capability description (and optionally an existing deployment to extend) and produces a validated Docker Compose file by reading authoritative per-microservice reference files. Use it whenever the user wants a VSS deployment composed for them — net-new profiles, extending a running stack, integrating a third-party system, or merging two profiles.

The skill has been evaluated on **IN-1 — streaming and on-demand video dense captioning**, which combines VIOS + RT-VLM + ELK. IN-2 (RT-CV + RT-DETR person detection) and the broader catalog land in subsequent phases. The skill itself does not need updates as new microservices are added — only `references/microservice-catalog.md` and the per-service `integrate-*.md` / `deploy-*.md` files.

## When to Use

- **Net-new profile**: "Create a profile for streaming and on-demand dense captioning"
- **Extension**: "Add agentic video search to my current base deployment at `./compose.yml`"
- **3P integration**: "Integrate my existing camera management system (compose at `./camera-mgmt/compose.yml`) with VSS"
- **Profile combination**: "Combine the Search Profile and Alerts Profile"
- **Helm output (post-v1)**: "Convert my dev-profile-alerts compose to a Helm chart"

If the user asks to **deploy** a generated compose, the skill will create (or update) a per-deployment deploy skill in Step 6 and prompt to invoke it in Step 8 — see those steps below. If the user asks to **call** a service's API (RT-VLM endpoints, VIOS endpoints, etc.), hand off to the relevant upstream skill (`vss-deploy-dense-captioning`, `vss-manage-video-io-storage`, `vss-setup-video-analytics-api`, etc.) — those are bundled into `<BUILD_DIR>/skills/` in Step 6.

> **`<BUILD_DIR>` convention.** All generated assets land under a single per-generation build directory chosen in Step 0. The default location is `_builds/<build-name>/` at the repository root (where `_builds/` is `.gitignore`d); the user can override at Step 0 (new under `_builds/`, overwrite an existing build folder, or supply a custom path). Throughout the rest of this document, paths written as `<BUILD_DIR>/compose.yml`, `<BUILD_DIR>/.env`, `<BUILD_DIR>/patched/`, etc. refer to file paths INSIDE that chosen directory. (Earlier revisions of this skill emitted to `skills/vss-build-vision-agent/build-output/`; any `build-output/` references that remain in prose below should be read as `<BUILD_DIR>/`.)

## How it Works

The skill executes nine steps. Steps 0–4 are read-only / interactive; steps 5–8 produce output.

```
Step 0:   Parse inputs and clarify (enumerate ALL .env files in repo)
Step 1:   Capability → microservice mapping (catalog lookup)
Step 2:   Read integrate-<microservice>.md (contract) + references/patch-<service>.md (component_services)
Step 3:   Conflict detection (ports, shared infra, GPU contention)
Step 4:   Architecture proposal + interactive decisions (GPU, shared infra, models)
Step 5:   Read deploy-<microservice>.md for selected services
Step 6:   Generate compose artifact + bundle related skills + create/update per-deployment deploy skill
Step 6.5: Apply standalone-compose patches (insert new gating flag into patched copies + strip undefined depends_on)
Step 7:   Dry-run validation (no real unexpanded ${...} tokens — exclude $$ escapes)
Step 8:   Review + write output + prompt to deploy
```

Each step is detailed below.

### Step 0 — Parse Inputs and Clarify

Read the user's prompt. Identify:

- **Capability description** — the verb-and-noun phrase describing what the user wants (e.g., "streaming dense captioning", "person counting", "agentic search").
- **Existing deployment** (optional) — path to a Docker Compose file or Helm chart to extend or merge with. If the user provided one, parse it and inventory existing services, images, ports, volumes, and shared infrastructure.
- **Third-party descriptor** (optional) — API base URL, OpenAPI / JSON schema file path, Kafka broker address and topic list, service / DB endpoint list, message bus type. Indicates a 3P integration scenario.
- **Output target** — `compose` (default) or `helm` (post-v1; report as not-yet-supported if requested).
- **Output path (`<BUILD_DIR>`)** — captured via the interactive prompt below; do NOT silently default to a fixed path. See `#### Choose the build directory (`<BUILD_DIR>`)` immediately below for the three-option prompt and resolution rules.

#### Choose the build directory (`<BUILD_DIR>`)

All generated assets land under a single per-generation directory referred to throughout this document as `<BUILD_DIR>`. The canonical home for builds is `_builds/` at the repository root (gitignored). Before doing any other Step 0 work, list `_builds/` and prompt the user with three options:

```
Where should generated assets go?
  (a) New build folder under _builds/  [default]
  (b) Overwrite an existing build folder under _builds/
  (c) Custom path (anywhere on disk)

Existing builds under _builds/:
  - <existing-folder-1>/   (last modified <ts>, profile <flag>)
  - <existing-folder-2>/   (last modified <ts>, profile <flag>)
  (none yet)
```

Resolve based on the user's choice:

- **(a) New build under `_builds/`** (default when the user does not specify). Resolve `<BUILD_DIR> = <repo-root>/_builds/<build-name>/`. The `<build-name>` is **deferred** to Step 6, where it is derived from the invented compose-profile flag — strip the `bp_developer_` prefix and replace remaining underscores with hyphens (e.g. `bp_developer_in_1` → `in-1`, so `<BUILD_DIR> = <repo-root>/_builds/in-1/`). If a folder with that name already exists under `_builds/`, **stop and confirm with the user** — do not silently overwrite. Offer to append a suffix (`in-1-2`, `in-1-3`, ...) or to switch to option (b). In autonomous mode, auto-append the next suffix.
- **(b) Overwrite an existing build folder.** Show the list of existing `_builds/*/` folders with their last-modified timestamp and the compose-profile flag from each folder's `MANIFEST.md` (if present). Ask which to overwrite. Confirm the choice and warn that the existing contents will be replaced — note that Docker volumes and model caches (`mdx_rtvi-hf-cache`, `mdx_rtvi-ngc-model-cache`, `mdx_cosmos_reason2_8b_cache`, etc.) survive because they are managed by Docker, not bind-mounted into `<BUILD_DIR>`. Resolve `<BUILD_DIR>` to the chosen path.
- **(c) Custom path.** Accept any absolute path, or a path relative to the repository root (resolve relative paths against `<repo-root>`). Validate that the parent directory exists and is writable; refuse to write to a path inside `deploy/docker/` (would risk modifying upstream composes — see `[[build-output-self-contained]]`). If the path already exists and contains a previous build (i.e. has a `compose.yml`), confirm overwrite the same way option (b) does.

After resolving, record `<BUILD_DIR>` in the in-session context. Every subsequent step writes only inside this directory. Step 6 also writes `<BUILD_DIR>/MANIFEST.md` recording the resolution choice (which option was picked, the resolved absolute path, and the compose-profile flag) so a future re-invocation against option (b) can identify the prior generation.

> *Autonomous mode:* if the user's request says "deploy autonomously" or the skill is running in a non-interactive eval harness, **default to option (a)** and let Step 6 derive the `<build-name>` from the invented flag. Auto-append a numeric suffix on collision instead of asking.

#### Enumerate ALL `.env` files in the source repo

VSS spreads its environment configuration across **multiple `.env` files** by concern. A skill that reads only the per-profile `dev-profile-*/.env` will miss component-internal variables and fail dry-run with errors like `invalid spec: :/home/vst/vst_release/streamer_videos: empty section between colons` (caused by an unset `${CLIP_STORAGE_PATH}` collapsing the host portion of a volume mount).

Run a recursive `.env` discovery against the source repo:

```bash
find <repo>/deploy -type f -name '.env' -not -path '*/_builds/*' -not -path '*/build-output/*' | sort
```

The canonical set is **10 core `.env` files** (4 developer profiles, 1 industry profile, 5 service-internal) plus a NIM hardware-tier set selected by `HW_PROFILE`. Read the full enumeration, per-file ownership table, NIM hardware-tier layout, and the variable-folding rule for Step 6 in `references/env-file-enumeration.md`.

If any of the following is unclear and the answer materially changes the architecture, **stop and ask** before proceeding:

- The capability description maps to multiple microservice candidates and the user has not narrowed it.
- The user has not said whether this is net-new or an extension of an existing deployment.
- The user wants a feature that requires a microservice not in `references/microservice-catalog.md`.

Do NOT silently fall back to a default profile when the user's intent is ambiguous.

### Step 1 — Capability → Microservice Mapping

Open `references/microservice-catalog.md`. Match the user's capability description against the **Capability tags** column. For each candidate microservice in the catalog:

- Check whether its required peer services (per its `integrate-<microservice>.md`) can be satisfied either by services already present in the user's existing deployment, or by services already in the candidate set.
- Mark the candidate as `reuse` (already in source deployment), `add` (must be brought up), or `unsatisfiable` (required peer missing and not addable from the catalog).

If a requested capability has no matching microservice in the catalog, report the gap to the user (NFR-6) and stop. Do NOT generate a partial compose with hallucinated services.

For IN-1 specifically:
- "Streaming dense captioning" → RT-VLM (carries `dense-captioning`, `streaming-inference`)
- "On-demand dense captioning" → RT-VLM (carries `on-demand-inference`)
- "Kafka publication" → covered by RT-VLM's Kafka outputs in its `integrate-rt-vlm.md`
- "Stored in Elasticsearch" → ELK (carries `caption-storage`, `kafka-ingestion`)
- "Video source" (RTSP and uploaded files) → VIOS (carries `rtsp-ingestion`, `video-upload`)

### Step 2 — Read the Integration Contract + Patch Reference for Each Candidate

For each selected microservice, read two sources: (a) its **integration contract** — `integrate-<microservice>.md` from `skills/<skill-folder>/references/` (peers, inputs/outputs, env vars, constraints); and (b) its **`component_services:` block + patch specifics** from build-vision-agent's own per-service **patch reference** — `references/patch-vios.md` (VIOS), `references/patch-rt-vlm.md` (RT-VLM), or `references/integrate-elk.md` (ELK, co-located). The catalog (`references/microservice-catalog.md`) names the patch reference per microservice. Extract:

- **Required peer services (prose)** — confirm each is satisfied (see Step 1).
- **`component_services:` block** — the structured YAML in the microservice's **patch reference** (`references/patch-<service>.md`, or `references/integrate-elk.md` for ELK) listing the upstream compose service-keys this microservice owns. The block has two parts:
  - `always:` — service-keys unconditionally added when this microservice is selected.
  - `variants:` — named decisions (e.g., `sensor_topology`, `vlm_backend`) the skill must resolve in Step 4 before producing the per-generation allow-list. Each variant has a `prompt:`, a `default:`, and a list of `options:` (each with a `when:` hint matching user-intent shapes, plus an `add:` list of service-keys to commit if that option is picked).
- **Inputs and Outputs** — Kafka topics, REST endpoints, file paths, schema references.
- **Environment variables** — note required vs. optional and their compose-side rewrites (e.g., `RTVI_VLM_KAFKA_TOPIC` → `KAFKA_TOPIC`).
- **Network requirements** — `network_mode`, port exposures, DNS expectations.
- **Known integration constraints** — startup ordering, single-instance restrictions, schema-version pinning.

Cite the specific section you relied on for each architectural decision (NFR-5). The architecture proposal in Step 4 must reference these citations.

### Step 3 — Conflict Detection

When extending an existing deployment or merging multiple sources, detect:

- **Port conflicts** — two services bound to the same host port (especially under `network_mode: host`, where conflicts are immediate failures).
- **Duplicate infrastructure** — multiple Elasticsearch / Kafka / Redis instances. The default is to consolidate to one shared instance; deviate only when the user has explicitly asked for isolation.
- **GPU contention** — multiple GPU-reserving services sharing a single GPU when the host has only one. Flag for Step 4 decision.
- **Service-name collisions** — same `container_name` across input composes. Resolve by renaming or by treating the second as a replacement.
- **Schema mismatches** — two services agreeing on a Kafka topic name but disagreeing on payload schema (especially relevant for 3P integrations).

Surface every detected conflict in the Step 4 proposal. Do not silently resolve.

### Step 4 — Architecture Proposal and Interactive Decisions

Present a structured proposal to the user before generating any output. Required sections:

- **Services to add** (with the specific reference-file section that motivated each).
- **Services to reuse** from the existing deployment (when extending).
- **Connections to establish** — Kafka topic wirings, REST URLs, shared volume mounts, network bridges.
- **Shared infrastructure strategy** — single vs. isolated Kafka / Elasticsearch / Redis (default: shared).
- **Conflicts and proposed resolutions** from Step 3.
- **Gaps** — required peer services or interfaces that cannot be satisfied (Step 1 result).
- **Architecture diagram** — an ASCII flowchart rendering the proposal visually. See the sub-section below.

For any proposal that includes VIOS + RT-VLM and a live/streaming path, the streaming media path must keep VIOS in the loop: external RTSP or NvStreamer validation source → VIOS sensor registration / streamprocessing → VIOS live proxy URL → RT-VLM `/v1/streams/add` / `/v1/generate_captions`. Do not propose direct NvStreamer → RT-VLM or direct external-camera → RT-VLM as the base-profile streaming path when the prompt also requires streamed video to be retrievable through default video IO and storage. The proposal must explicitly mention the VIOS live proxy (dynamic port when applicable) and that RT-VLM consumes the VIOS-proxied stream, while VIOS handles registration, recording/playback, and stream retrieval.

#### Architecture diagram (ASCII)

Render the proposal as an ASCII flowchart (Unicode box-drawing, top-to-bottom layers) so the user can SEE the wiring, not just read it. The diagram is text-based, displays inline in the terminal at Step 4, renders identically in any Markdown viewer over SSH, and persists losslessly in `<BUILD_DIR>/MANIFEST.md`.

Required content (one node per allow-listed service grouped by logical layer; one labeled edge per connection from the integrate refs' `§ Integration Interfaces`; external actors as top-level nodes; deployment shape in a comment), the canonical IN-1 example to use as a template, and the multi-diagram split rule (>~30 nodes) are spelled out in `references/architecture-diagram-template.md`. Do not collapse allow-listed init/wait services into shorthand like `+ 5 inits`; list service keys such as `kafka-topic-init-container` and `elasticsearch-init-container` explicitly. Every layer or grouped external-actor header must include both `network_mode` and `GPU`; use `GPU: none` for non-GPU layers.

Step 6 MUST embed this same diagram verbatim in `<BUILD_DIR>/MANIFEST.md § Architecture` so the operator (and any future regeneration / re-deploy) has a permanent record. Do NOT regenerate the diagram in Step 6 — copy the Step 4 output verbatim.

Then prompt the user for any of the following that are ambiguous (FR-4):

- **`component_services:` variant resolutions.** For each `variants:` block surfaced by Step 2 (schema in `references/component-services-schema.md`), present the variant's selector key (e.g. `sensor_topology`) and the list of `cases:` keys (e.g. `rtsp-and-uploaded`, `warehouse-2d`, `warehouse-3d`, `warehouse-mv3dt`). Use the user's prompt language to pre-suggest a default, then ask explicitly when the choice is non-obvious. The chosen case-name is the `deployment_shape:` written to the sidecar in the next section. Common cases:
  - VIOS `sensor_topology` — `rtsp-and-uploaded` vs. `warehouse-2d` / `warehouse-3d` / `warehouse-mv3dt`.
  - RT-VLM `vlm_backend` (when the integrate doc declares one) — in-process vs. one of the sibling NIMs.
- **GPU assignment** — which physical GPU index each GPU-requiring service should land on. Use `RT_VLM_DEVICE_ID`, `RT_CV_DEVICE_ID`, etc., names from the source compose.
- **Shared vs. isolated infrastructure** — when the user supplied a source compose with its own Kafka / ES, ask explicitly.
- **Endpoint conflicts** — when port collisions cannot be resolved automatically.
- **Model selection** — when multiple VLM / LLM options are compatible.
- **Remote vs. local inference** — for NIM-based services (RT-VLM in `openai-compat` mode, LLM NIMs).
- **External RTSP source location** (when the prompt mentions live stream input) — is the source a real public RTSP server, a real IP camera, a sibling container, or a host process? **If the user supplies a real camera / RTSP URL**, use it as the upstream source that VIOS registers first, then feed RT-VLM the VIOS live proxy URL when the profile includes VIOS playback/storage requirements. Pre-flight reachability from the relevant container path before generating the compose; if the source is a non-VSS sidecar, recommend co-locating on the same compose network with `--network-alias` (see `integrate-rt-vlm.md` § Network Requirements > Reaching external RTSP sources); if the source is on the host, verify Docker's iptables FORWARD chain has the necessary rule by probing `docker exec rtvi-vlm bash -c "exec 3<>/dev/tcp/${HOST_IP}/${RTSP_PORT}"`. **If the user did NOT supply a real source but the capability has a live/streaming path**, include the **NvStreamer validation harness** as a synthetic RTSP source (a stored sample video served over RTSP by `vss-vios-nvstreamer`, replacing the legacy `mediamtx + ffmpeg` dummy-stream sidecar) — record the decision in the sidecar's `validation_harness:` key and emit the service in Step 6. The inclusion rule, the service block, config/sample-video staging, and the NvStreamer → VIOS → RT-VLM smoke sequence are all in `references/validation-harness.md`. NvStreamer is a validation-harness component ONLY — NOT a `sensor_topology` variant and NOT a `component_services:` entry, and its RTSP URL is never the final RT-VLM input for VIOS-backed base-profile streaming.

Wait for confirmation before continuing. The only exception is **autonomous mode** — when the user's request explicitly says "deploy autonomously" or "run without confirmation", or when running inside a non-interactive eval harness with that permission.

#### Step 4 output — per-generation allow-list sidecar (`build-output/allow-list.yml`)

Once the user confirms the architecture, synthesize a flat allow-list of upstream compose service-keys by **unioning the `component_services:` blocks** of every microservice in the proposal, **resolving each `variants:` block against the user's chosen `deployment_shape`**, and dropping any entry whose `required: false` is excluded by the architecture (e.g. an optional MQTT broker that the user opted out of).

Write the result to `<BUILD_DIR>/allow-list.yml`. This sidecar is the **only** input Step 6.5 reads — the catalog, the per-microservice integrate files, and `SKILL.md` itself are NOT re-parsed at patch time. Persist the sidecar before invoking Step 6, which expects the flag chosen here to be reused.

If the **NvStreamer validation harness** was included (per the External RTSP source decision above — live/streaming capability AND no real camera supplied), also record a top-level `validation_harness:` key in the sidecar:

```yaml
validation_harness:
  rtsp_source: nvstreamer
  sample_video: <sample-video-filename>     # staged into ${VSS_DATA_DIR}/videos/<build-name>/ by Step 6; no whitespace
```

`validation_harness:` is an **extra** top-level key — Step 6.5 reads only `flag` / `deployment_shape` / `services` and ignores it; Step 6 reads it to emit the NvStreamer service and wire the streaming smoke sequence. NvStreamer is NOT an allow-list `services:` entry (it is not a `component_services:`-declared microservice). Cite `references/validation-harness.md` for the decision. Omit the key entirely when the harness is not included.

The sidecar schema, a worked IN-1 example, and the union rules (per-microservice contribution; variant case selection; dedup of identical `(key, file)` pairs; catalog-inconsistency error on conflicting `file:` paths) live in `references/allow-list-sidecar.md`. The full schema for `component_services:` blocks is in `references/component-services-schema.md`.

### Step 5 — Read `deploy-<microservice>.md` for Each Selected Service

For each service the user confirmed in Step 4, read its `deploy-<microservice>.md`. Extract:

- **Container image and tag pattern** — multiarch tag selection (`3.1.0` vs. `3.1.0-sbsa`) based on the host's architecture.
- **GPU requirements** — minimum VRAM, `device_ids` reservation block, `runtime: nvidia` requirement, `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.
- **Storage** — required bind mounts and named volumes, with size estimates and required permissions (`chmod 777` patterns, no recursive `chown`).
- **Startup behavior** — `depends_on` conditions, healthcheck endpoint and tuning, `start_period` (especially RT-VLM's `1200s` cold-boot window).
- **Prerequisites** — NGC API key, HF token, NVIDIA Container Toolkit, free ports, outbound network requirements.

Validate that the host's GPU configuration (gathered in Step 0 if the user provided it, or queried interactively) satisfies the per-service VRAM and architecture requirements. If not, return to Step 4 to renegotiate.

### Step 6 — Generate the Compose Artifact

Write the compose file following VSS dev-profile conventions:

- **Top-level `compose.yml`** with `include:` directives pointing to per-profile subdirectories (the existing `dev-profile-base/compose.yml`, `dev-profile-search/compose.yml`, etc., pattern).
- **Environment variable substitution** for all secrets, API keys, and host-specific values. Use `${VAR_NAME}` everywhere; emit a corresponding `.env.template` in the same output directory listing every variable with comments describing purpose and required values. `.env.template` is mandatory even when a concrete `.env` is also written for eval or local smoke testing; missing `.env.template` is a generation error.
- **`.env` overwrite guard.** Before writing `<BUILD_DIR>/.env`, check whether the file already exists. If it does AND it does not contain placeholder sentinel values (`NGC_CLI_API_KEY` is non-empty and does not match `dummy_*`, AND `HOST_IP` is not `127.0.0.1`), the file holds production credentials — overwriting it with dry-run values would corrupt a live deployment. In that case: write the generated content to `<BUILD_DIR>/.env.new` instead and surface a conflict notice: *"`<BUILD_DIR>/.env` already contains production values — wrote new generation to `.env.new`; diff and merge manually before deploying."* If `.env.new` already exists from a prior aborted generation, confirm with the user before overwriting it. Write directly to `.env` only when: (a) it does not yet exist, (b) it exists and contains only empty/placeholder values, or (c) the user has explicitly authorized an overwrite. Surfaced live 2026-06-18, IN-1 expanded eval.
- **GPU device reservations** using `deploy.resources.reservations.devices` with explicit `device_ids` from Step 4.
- **Health checks** for every service that exposes an HTTP endpoint, copied from the per-service `deploy-<microservice>.md` (do not invent — use the exact compose values).
- **`restart` policy** — match the source compose's pattern. VSS conventions: `restart: always` for persistent services, `restart: on-failure` for one-shot init containers, `restart: unless-stopped` where the source uses it.
- **`depends_on:` blocks** with explicit `condition` values from the per-service references (`service_healthy`, `service_started`, `service_completed_successfully`).
- **Compose-profile gating — invent a new flag; patch only build-output copies.** Assign the deployment a unique blueprint profile name following the catalog convention (`bp_developer_in_<N>`, `bp_developer_an_<N>`, or `bp_developer_at_<N>` per the active IN-/AN-/AT- entry in `INTEGRATION-PLAN.md` § Profile Catalog). The flag is **invented for this generation only** — it need not exist anywhere upstream, and upstream service composes are never modified. Step 6.5 copies each involved upstream compose into `<BUILD_DIR>/patched/` preserving its repo-relative path and original filename, then adds the new flag to every relevant service's `profiles:` list in those local copies (additive — existing upstream flags like `bp_developer_alerts_2d_vlm`, `bp_developer_search_2d`, `bp_wh_*` stay). Do not flatten or rename patched YAML files: `deploy/docker/services/infra/compose.yml` becomes `<BUILD_DIR>/patched/services/infra/compose.yml`, `deploy/docker/services/rtvi/rtvi-vlm/rtvi-vlm-docker-compose.yml` becomes `<BUILD_DIR>/patched/services/rtvi/rtvi-vlm/rtvi-vlm-docker-compose.yml`, etc. The emitted `<BUILD_DIR>/compose.yml` `include:`s the patched copies by those preserved paths, so `docker compose --env-file <BUILD_DIR>/.env -f <BUILD_DIR>/compose.yml --profile <new-flag> up -d` deploys against the build-output tree without ever touching the upstream repo. For reference only, upstream's currently-declared flags are: developer (`bp_developer_base_2d`, `bp_developer_search_2d`, `bp_developer_alerts_2d_vlm`, `bp_developer_alerts_2d_cv`, `bp_developer_lvs_2d`, plus `*_IGX-THOR` / `*_AGX-THOR` variants) and warehouse-industry (`bp_wh_{2d,kafka,redis,auto_calib}_*`); inventing a fresh flag avoids colliding with any of them.

For Helm output (post-v1, not implemented in v0.1): generate one Deployment / StatefulSet per service, one Service manifest per service, GPU resource requests parameterized in `values.yaml`, secrets in Secret manifests, all other config in ConfigMaps, with VSS labeling conventions (`app.kubernetes.io/part-of: vss`).

#### MANIFEST.md contract (required for every generated build)

Step 6 MUST write `<BUILD_DIR>/MANIFEST.md` as an operator-facing audit record, not a loose summary. Missing any required manifest section is a generation error. Before declaring Step 6 complete, reopen `MANIFEST.md` and verify these headings and contents exist:

- **`## Build Identity`** — resolved build directory, compose profile flag, deployment shape, selected variants, generated files, and whether Step 0 created a fresh build or overwrote an existing one.
- **`## Architecture`** — the Step 4 architecture diagram copied verbatim, including the surrounding code fence. If the build is resumed and no Step 4 diagram is available in context, reconstruct it before writing files using `references/architecture-diagram-template.md`; never replace it with ad hoc per-service boxes. The diagram must use one double-line-frame box per logical layer, layer headers annotated with both `network_mode` and `GPU` (`GPU: none` for non-GPU layers), all allow-listed service keys inside their layer boxes including one-shot init/wait services such as `kafka-topic-init-container` and `elasticsearch-init-container`, and inter-layer arrows labeled with protocol + port/topic/schema/shared-volume. If external actors are grouped into a layer, that header must also include both annotations.
- **`## Integration References` (NFR-5)** — cite exact `integrate-*.md` reference file sections that justify the generated wiring. Cite section names, not just filenames. Deployment references (`deploy-*.md`) and source config files may be cited as supplementary implementation evidence, but they do NOT satisfy NFR-5 by themselves and cannot replace the corresponding `integrate-*.md` citation. For every selected microservice, include the `integrate-<microservice>.md` sections used for inputs, outputs, required peers, environment, network, and GPU decisions. For IN-1, this section must include at minimum: `integrate-rt-vlm.md` sections covering RT-VLM stream/file inputs, Kafka caption output, and bridge/GPU behavior; `integrate-vios-service.md` sections covering uploaded-file playback, RTSP registration/proxy, and SDRC-routed VIOS topology; and `integrate-elk.md` sections covering Kafka -> Logstash -> Elasticsearch caption indexing.
- **`## Patch Audit`** — copied compose files, inserted profile-flag sites, stripped `depends_on` entries, materialized bind-mount files, bundled skills, and the generated deploy skill.

#### Emit the NvStreamer validation harness (when the sidecar has `validation_harness:`)

If Step 4 recorded a `validation_harness: { rtsp_source: nvstreamer, ... }` key in the sidecar, emit the synthetic RTSP source so the generated deployment can exercise its live/streaming path without a real camera. Do all of the following (full contract in `references/validation-harness.md`):

1. **Emit the `nvstreamer-validation` service block** into a patched copy under `<BUILD_DIR>/patched/` that the build-output `compose.yml` `include:`s (never into an upstream file). Model it on `deploy/docker/developer-profiles/dev-profile-alerts/compose.yml § nvstreamer-alerts`: image `vss-vios-nvstreamer:${NVSTREAMER_IMAGE_TAG}`, `ADAPTOR=streamer`, `HTTP_PORT=${NVSTREAMER_HTTP_PORT}` (default 31000), RTSP pool 31554–31561, `network_mode: host`, `container_name: vss-vios-nvstreamer`, `depends_on: broker-health-check`, and a `profiles:` list carrying only the invented flag (added by Step 6.5 Patch 1). The block is in `references/validation-harness.md § 2`. NvStreamer is **NOT** an allow-list `services:` entry and **NOT** a `sensor_topology` variant — emit it directly here.
2. **Stage the sample video** into `${VSS_DATA_DIR}/videos/<build-name>/` (the host dir bind-mounted at `/home/vst/vst_release/streamer_videos`). `mkdir -p` + `chmod -R 777` it; copy a known-good H.264/H.265 MP4/MKV/TS with a whitespace-free filename; record the filename as `validation_harness.sample_video`. The skill does NOT fetch/generate video — prompt the operator for a path if none is on the host (eval-harness mode documents the path). NvStreamer auto-discovers it (`sensorId == streamId == name == stem`).
3. **Add `.env` entries**: `NVSTREAMER_IMAGE_TAG` (reuse the VIOS tag), `NVSTREAMER_HTTP_PORT=31000`, `NVSTREAMER_INSTALL_ADDITIONAL_PACKAGES=true` (the same libav gate VIOS uploads need). Pre-resolve any `${VAR}` chains during env-folding so dry-run has zero unexpanded tokens.
4. **Materialize the config files** (handled by Step 6.5 Patch 3): the two `nvstreamer/configs/{vst-config.json,vst-storage.json}` are copied into `<BUILD_DIR>/patched/nvstreamer/configs/`.

The generated deploy skill's post-deploy smoke test (below) must include the NvStreamer → VIOS → RT-VLM streaming sequence from `references/validation-harness.md § 4`.

#### Bundle related skills

After writing the compose artifact, copy the skill folders the operator will need to interact with this deployment into `build-output/skills/`. Scope is **only what already exists** in the VSS repo's skills folder — do NOT synthesize a new use-case skill at this step.

What to bundle:

- **Microservice skills**: for each service selected in Step 4, look up the canonical skill folder name from `references/microservice-catalog.md` and copy `<vss-repo>/skills/<skill-name>/` -> `build-output/skills/<skill-name>/`.
- **Base vision profile operation skills**: when the prompt maps to the IN-1 / base vision profile shape (VIOS + RT-VLM + ELK/Kafka for VLM Q&A plus dense captioning over uploaded and streamed video), Step 6 is incomplete until all four existing operation skill folders have been copied verbatim into `build-output/skills/`: `vss-manage-video-io-storage/`, `vss-deploy-dense-captioning/`, `vss-ask-video/`, and `vss-generate-video-report/`. These skills are copied for Codex/OpenClaw operation of that generated profile; they do not add runtime microservices to this base-profile compose allow-list. If any of the four source folders is missing from `<vss-repo>/skills/`, stop and report a blocking repository-layout gap instead of declaring generation complete. Other profile prompts may still select additional microservices through the catalog when their requested capability requires them.
- **Use-case skills**: scan `<vss-repo>/skills/` for top-level skill folders whose `description:` frontmatter matches the capability description from Step 0 (e.g., `streaming-dense-captioning`, `agentic-search`, `person-counting`). Copy each match. **If none match, skip — do not create one.**

Copy the entire skill folder verbatim (including `SKILL.md`, `references/`, `scripts/`, `eval/`). Do not edit any bundled file. Record every bundled skill in `MANIFEST.md` with its source path and a one-line purpose.

#### Create or update the per-deployment deploy skill

Generate a self-contained deploy skill at `build-output/skills/deploy-<profile-name>/SKILL.md` that hardcodes the exact paths and values for this deployment. The `<profile-name>` is derived from the invented flag in Step 6 by stripping the `bp_developer_` prefix and replacing any remaining underscores with hyphens: `bp_developer_in_1` → `deploy-in-1`, `bp_developer_an_1` → `deploy-an-1`, `bp_developer_at_1` → `deploy-at-1`.

Exception: for the IN-1 / base vision profile shape described above, the generated deploy skill MUST be named `deploy-base-vision-profile` and written to `build-output/skills/deploy-base-vision-profile/SKILL.md`. The compose profile flag remains `bp_developer_in_1`; only the harness skill name is specialized so operators can invoke a stable base-profile deploy command.

The generated SKILL.md must include:

- **Compose path** — absolute or `build-output/`-relative path to the generated `compose.yml`.
- **Env file path** — path to `.env.template` and an instruction to copy it to `.env` and fill in every variable before deploy.
- **GPU assignments** — the device-id map confirmed in Step 4 (`RT_VLM_DEVICE_ID=0`, etc.), so the operator can sanity-check against the host before bring-up.
- **Per-service health endpoints + `start_period`** — copied from each `deploy-<microservice>.md`. RT-VLM's `1200s` cold-boot window must be called out explicitly.
- **Bring-up command** — the exact `docker compose --env-file build-output/.env -f build-output/compose.yml --profile <profile-name> up -d` invocation.
- **Health-check loop** — poll each service's healthcheck endpoint until pass or per-service `start_period` timeout; fail loudly with the specific service name when a check times out.
- **Tear-down command** — `docker compose --env-file build-output/.env -f build-output/compose.yml --profile <profile-name> down -v` (note: `-v` removes named volumes; warn the operator inline).
- **Post-deploy smoke test** — one curl or kafka-console-consumer command per "Outputs" section in the bundled microservice skills' `integrate-<microservice>.md`, so the operator can confirm the wiring actually works. **When the NvStreamer validation harness is included** (sidecar `validation_harness:` key), also emit the streaming-path smoke sequence from `references/validation-harness.md § 4`: verify NvStreamer up (`GET :31000/vst/api/v1/sensor/version` → `type=="streamer"`), the sample auto-discovered (`/sensor/list`), read the RTSP URL from `/sensor/<stem>/streams` (NEVER construct the 315xx port), register it with VIOS `POST :30888/vst/api/v1/sensor/add` (field `sensorUrl`), feed the VIOS proxy `rtsp://${HOST_IP}:30554/live/<sensorId>` (use `${HOST_IP}`, not localhost) to RT-VLM `POST :8018/v1/streams/add`, and assert `mdx-vlm-captions` offset advance + ES `default_<id>` doc count FROM THE LIVE PATH (distinct from the VOD/upload check). This validates the streaming half.

If a deploy skill already exists at `build-output/skills/deploy-<profile-name>/SKILL.md` (the user is regenerating the same profile), **overwrite it** with the new values. Do not append — stale GPU assignments or stale env paths from a prior run would silently misdirect deploy.

Record the generated deploy skill in `MANIFEST.md` with the bring-up and tear-down commands inline so an operator can read the manifest and execute without opening the skill.

### Step 6.5 — Apply Standalone-Compose Patches

The build-output deploys a unique, never-before-seen profile generated by the skill. To make that work against the upstream's existing compose tree **without modifying upstream files**, the skill copies the involved upstream service composes into `<BUILD_DIR>/patched/` and applies five patches.

The patched tree MUST preserve the upstream repo-relative directory structure and filenames under `deploy/docker/`. For example, copy `deploy/docker/services/infra/compose.yml` to `<BUILD_DIR>/patched/services/infra/compose.yml`, not `<BUILD_DIR>/patched/infra-compose.yml`; copy `deploy/docker/services/rtvi/rtvi-vlm/rtvi-vlm-docker-compose.yml` to `<BUILD_DIR>/patched/services/rtvi/rtvi-vlm/rtvi-vlm-docker-compose.yml`, not `<BUILD_DIR>/patched/rtvi-vlm-docker-compose.yml`. All generated `include:` entries and `PATCHES.md` rows must reference these preserved paths. Flattened or renamed patched compose files are a generation error because they break relative bind mounts, nested-include neutralization, and Harbor path checks.

Apply these patches to the preserved-path copies:

- **Patch 0** — pre-flight host preparation (run at deploy time): validate `.env` secrets, create bind-mount dirs with permissions (incl. `${VSS_DATA_DIR}/data_log/redis/{data,log}` — a missing redis log dir crash-loops Redis with `Can't open the log file: Permission denied`, which cascades into `sdr-controller` Redis failures and a non-serving VIOS RTSP proxy; see `references/standalone-compose-patches.md § Patch 0`), clear conflicting named volumes, kill orphan containers from prior generations (the orphan-container grep includes `vss-vios-nvstreamer` so a stale validation-harness streamer holding port 31000 / the 31554–31561 RTSP pool under `network_mode: host` is detected), NGC login, profile-flag collision check.
- **Patch 1** — insert the invented gating flag into the `profiles:` list of every `(key, file)` pair in `<BUILD_DIR>/allow-list.yml`. Additive (preserves upstream flags); each sidecar entry is patched at exactly one site. Handles both inline and block-style `profiles:` lists. When the NvStreamer validation harness was emitted in Step 6, Patch 1 also adds the same invented flag to the `nvstreamer-validation` service block (it rides the main flag — not a separate one).
- **Patch 2** — strip undefined `depends_on` entries. Compose ≥ v2.36 rejects standalone projects with unresolvable `depends_on` even when `required: false`. For each allow-listed service, walk its `depends_on:` — keep defined peers, strip undefined peers with `required: false`, error on undefined peers without `required: false` (allow-list/upstream inconsistency).
- **Patch 3** — materialize relative-path bind-mount source files. The patched tree under `<BUILD_DIR>/patched/` contains only the patched YAML; Docker would silently create empty directories for any relative bind source, causing obscure container exits. Walk every patched compose's `volumes:` and `cp` upstream sources into the patched copy, **preserving the executable bit on scripts (`chmod 0755`)**. The canonical case is the **SDRC compose** `services/infra/sdrc/docker-compose.yaml`, which relative-binds four sibling shell scripts (`./render-config.sh`, `./wdm-env-from-config.sh`, `./wait-for-redis.sh`, `./wait-for-docker-workloads.sh`) plus two writable runtime dirs (`./log`, `./.wdm-env`, created mode 0777). If a `.sh` script is left unmaterialized, Docker creates it as a root-owned empty directory and the init container fails with `exit 126` (`/bin/sh: /render-config.sh: Permission denied`), stalling the whole SDRC chain. Sub-case: SDRC config templates (`config.yml.tmpl` + `docker_cluster_config-streamprocessing.json.tmpl`) are env-var-resolved (not relative), so handle them explicitly when `sdr-controller` is in the allow-list. Sub-case: NvStreamer validation-harness configs — when the sidecar has `validation_harness:`, copy `deploy/docker/developer-profiles/dev-profile-alerts/nvstreamer/configs/{vst-config.json,vst-storage.json}` into `<BUILD_DIR>/patched/nvstreamer/configs/` so the emitted `nvstreamer-validation` service's config binds resolve.
- **Patch 4** — neutralize nested `include:` directives in copied composes. Some upstream composes (notably `services/infra/compose.yml`) carry their own top-level `include:` of sibling files (`./haproxy/compose.yml`, `./sdrc/docker-compose.yaml`). Copied into `<BUILD_DIR>/patched/`, those relative paths fail to resolve (`no such file or directory`) and can double-include a file the build `compose.yml` already orchestrates. Strip the nested `include:` from each patched copy — the build's top-level `compose.yml` is the single include orchestrator; every needed file is already an explicit entry there, and unneeded ones (e.g. `haproxy`, not allow-listed and not a `depends_on` target) are correctly dropped. Record each dropped include in `PATCHES.md`.

The full Patch 0 pre-flight checklist, the Patch 1 / Patch 2 / Patch 3 / Patch 4 pseudocode and rationale, the "why an allow-list, not patch-then-exclude" architectural note, the VIOS + SDRC mandatory-stack note, and the per-allow-listed-service IN-1 behavior breakdown all live in `references/standalone-compose-patches.md`. Read it before modifying any patch logic — every entry there is grounded in a live deploy failure mode.

Record the chosen flag at the top of `<BUILD_DIR>/MANIFEST.md`, note every stripped `depends_on` entry in `MANIFEST.md`, and add a row to `PATCHES.md` for every materialized file/directory so the operator can audit.

### Step 7 — Dry-Run Validation

After writing, validate before declaring success. The dry-run command depends on whether the source repo splits env vars across multiple files (Step 0):

```bash
# If single combined env produced in Step 6:
docker compose --env-file .env -f compose.yml config > resolved.yml

# If layering multiple env files (preferred when component .envs are kept separate):
docker compose --env-file .env --env-file <repo>/deploy/docker/services/vios/vst.env \
  -f compose.yml config > resolved.yml
```

Then check there are no **real** unexpanded `${...}` tokens. Compose intentionally preserves `$${...}` (double-dollar) — these are escape sequences that pass `${...}` through to the container's shell at runtime — so a naive `grep '\${'` produces false positives. Match `${` only when **not** preceded by another `$`:

```bash
# Real unexpanded tokens: ${...} not preceded by another $
if grep -nE '(^|[^$])\${[A-Za-z_]' resolved.yml; then
  echo "FAIL: resolved.yml has real unexpanded variables (above)"
  exit 1
fi
echo "PASS — no real unexpanded tokens"
```

Real unexpanded tokens indicate either a missing env entry or a typo. Either fix the `.env` and regenerate, or surface the gap to the user — do not hand-edit `resolved.yml`.

For Helm output (post-v1): run `helm lint` instead.

### Step 8 — Review, Write Output, and Prompt to Deploy

Present a summary of the generated artifact:

- File paths written
- Service list with images and assigned ports
- GPU assignments
- Shared infrastructure decisions
- `.env.template` location and the variables the user must fill in
- Bundled skills (microservice + use-case, from Step 6)
- Generated per-deployment deploy skill (`deploy-base-vision-profile` for the base vision profile, otherwise `deploy-<profile-name>`, from Step 6) with its bring-up command

Show the diff if the operation modified an existing deployment. Wait for user confirmation, then write all files to the output directory. Always emit a `MANIFEST.md` that satisfies the Step 6 MANIFEST.md contract: build identity, the verbatim Step 4 architecture diagram, NFR-5 integration-reference citations, and patch audit. Operators reading the manifest should see both the generated wiring and the reference sections that justified it without re-running the skill.

#### Prompt to deploy

After all files are written, ask the user explicitly:

> "Deploy this profile now? [y/N]"

- **If `y`**: invoke the `deploy-<profile-name>` skill generated in Step 6. The skill should run from `build-output/` as its working directory so it picks up the generated `compose.yml`, `.env`, and `MANIFEST.md`. Before invoking, confirm the user has copied `.env.template` to `.env` and filled in required values (NGC API key, HF token, host IP, GPU IDs) — if `.env` is missing or still contains template placeholders, stop and ask the user to fill them in.
- **If `n` or no response**: print the bring-up command and the skill invocation command so the user can run either later:
  ```
  # Direct compose:
  docker compose --env-file build-output/.env -f build-output/compose.yml --profile <profile-name> up -d

  # Or via the generated skill:
  /deploy-<profile-name>
  ```

The autonomous-mode exception from Step 4 applies here too: when the user's original request explicitly said "deploy autonomously" or "and deploy", treat as `y` without prompting. When running in a non-interactive eval harness without explicit deploy intent, treat as `n` and just print the commands.

## IN-1 Walkthrough — Concrete Example

A worked end-to-end example of the nine-step flow against the **IN-1 streaming + on-demand dense captioning** prompt — including the caption-topic gotcha (`RTVI_VLM_KAFKA_TOPIC=mdx-vlm-captions`, since the raw compose default `vision-llm-messages` is unsubscribed by both Logstash pipelines), the GPU-placement and `vlm_backend` decisions surfaced in Step 4, and the SDRC-template materialization done by Step 6.5 / Patch 3 — lives in `references/example-walkthroughs.md`.

## Operating Principles

- **Reference files are the source of truth.** Never hallucinate a service's image, port, env var, or peer dependency. If the reference file does not say it, do not generate it.
- **Cite specific sections.** Every architectural decision must point to the reference file and section that motivated it (NFR-5).
- **Surface gaps, do not paper over them.** A missing reference file is a stop condition, not a "best-effort" trigger (NFR-6). The catalog determines what the skill can compose.
- **Prompt for ambiguous decisions.** GPU assignment, shared infra, model selection, remote vs. local inference — all explicit user choices, not silent defaults (FR-4).
- **Idempotency.** Running the skill twice on the same input must produce the same output (NFR-3). The output compose must support `docker compose up` twice without error.
- **No silent modification.** When extending an existing deployment, every change to a pre-existing service must surface in the architecture proposal and diff (NFR-2).
- **Secrets via env substitution only.** No plaintext credentials in generated files (NFR-4). The `.env.template` lists every variable; values are the user's responsibility.

## Tear Down

`build-vision-agent` does not bring services up or down itself — that is the per-deployment `deploy-<profile-name>` skill generated in Step 6. Tear down a running profile with its skill (which knows the right `--profile` gate and volume cleanup):

```
/deploy-<profile-name>            # bring up
/deploy-<profile-name> down       # tear down (or use the explicit command in MANIFEST.md)
```

To remove the generated build artifacts themselves (compose, bundled skills, generated deploy skill):

```bash
rm -rf ./build-output/
```
