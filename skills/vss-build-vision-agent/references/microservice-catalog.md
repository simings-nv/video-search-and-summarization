# VSS Microservice Catalog

Index of every VSS microservice that has reference files the `build-vision-agent` skill can resolve. Each entry maps a microservice name and capability tags to the skill folder where its `integrate-<microservice>.md` and `deploy-<microservice>.md` live.

**How the skill uses this file:**

1. Parse the user's capability description.
2. Tag-match against the `Capability tags` column to identify candidate services.
3. For each candidate, follow `Skill folder` → `integrate-<microservice>.md` to read the integration contract, then `deploy-<microservice>.md` for deployment requirements.
4. Cross-reference declared peer services in each candidate's `Required Peer Services` section to compose the full service list. Each `integrate-<microservice>.md § Required Peer Services` declares a structured `component_services:` block listing the upstream compose service-keys that microservice owns; the skill unions those blocks across confirmed candidates to produce the per-generation allow-list that drives Step 6.5.

**How to register a new microservice:**

1. Create `skills/<your-skill-folder>/references/integrate-<your-microservice>.md` and `deploy-<your-microservice>.md` per the schemas in `integrate-microservice-schema.md` and `deploy-microservice-schema.md`.
2. Include a `component_services:` block in `§ Required Peer Services` declaring the upstream compose service-keys this microservice brings into a deployment (and any variant choices the skill must surface to the user).
3. Run `scripts/validate-references.py` to confirm the files pass schema validation.
4. Add a row to the table below with the microservice name, skill folder path, and capability tags.
5. Open a PR — the CI workflow re-runs validation on every reference file.

> **Note on reference file pair convention.** Each catalog row names the upstream skill folder AND a target `integrate-<microservice>.md` / `deploy-<microservice>.md` pair. The pair-file convention is introduced by `vss-build-vision-agent`. The current upstream state of each pair is shown inline in the table cells (current filename ⇢ target filename). Rows where the cell reads "— ⇢ `target.md` *(pending)*" indicate the target file does not yet exist upstream and must be authored.
>
> **Observed upstream conventions** (Phase 1a/1b/1c rollout work):
>
> - **Naming convention (updated 2026-05-26):** the skill **honors upstream naming** rather than enforcing a single target shape. Where upstream already ships a `deploy-<short-name>-service.md` (5 skills) or a `deploy-vss-<skill-folder>.md` (2 skills), that name is **retained as canonical** — no rename. The `integrate-<service>.md` companion is authored alongside under the same shape if the upstream skill has any pair-file scheme, or as plain `integrate-<short-name>.md` otherwise. The earlier rollout plan to "drop the `-service.md` suffix" / "rename long-form deploys to short form" is **reversed**: Phase 1a/1b/1c work is now authoring the missing companion file(s), not renaming existing ones. Phase 1a confirmed this for VIOS (`integrate-vios-service.md` + `deploy-vios-service.md` both retained with `-service.md`) and RT-VLM (`deploy-rt-vlm-service.md` retained; companion authored as plain `integrate-rt-vlm.md`).
> - **`integrate-*.md` is almost entirely absent upstream.** The single exception is `vss-deploy-video-embedding/references/integrate-vss-deploy-video-embedding.md` (long-form). Every other catalog row's `integrate-<service>.md` is net-new authoring work.
> - **Four upstream skills have no `references/` folder at all** — `vss-ask-video`, `vss-query-analytics`, `vss-generate-video-report`, `vss-generate-video-report-rag`. Rollout work: create the folder plus both pair files.
> - **Three skills have a `references/` folder but no deploy file** — `vss-manage-alerts` (has `alert-notify.md`, `alert-subscriptions.md`), `vss-search-archive` (has `discovery_modes.md`, `troubleshooting.md`), `vss-manage-video-io-storage` (has the three retained refs `api-reference.md` + `integrate-vios-service.md` + `deploy-vios-service.md` after the Phase 1a authoring). The integrate content for the remaining two largely lives in existing docs; rollout work is consolidation + authoring under the upstream-respecting name.
>
> The catalog declares the **canonical** name per row (matching upstream where it exists). The skill's Step 2/Step 5 logic resolves that filename directly; Phase 1a/1b/1c work is what makes the missing files exist.

## Catalog

### Phase 1a (IN-1 — VIOS + RT-VLM + ELK)

| Microservice | Skill folder | Integration ref (current ⇢ target) | Deployment ref (current ⇢ target) | Capability tags |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| VIOS (Video Storage) | `skills/vss-manage-video-io-storage/` | `integrate-vios-service.md` ✓ *(neutral contract; `component_services` + patch specifics in `references/patch-vios.md`)* | `deploy-vios-service.md` ✓ | `video-storage`, `rtsp-ingestion`, `video-upload`, `clip-extraction`, `snapshot`, `sensor-management` |
| RT-VLM | `skills/vss-deploy-dense-captioning/` | `integrate-rt-vlm.md` ✓ *(neutral contract; `component_services` + patch specifics in `references/patch-rt-vlm.md`)* | `deploy-rt-vlm-service.md` ✓ *(canonical; sibling `kafka-workflows.md` is retained as a cited reference, not folded)* | `dense-captioning`, `vlm`, `vision-language`, `streaming-inference`, `on-demand-inference`, `alert-detection` |
| ELK (Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana) | `skills/vss-build-vision-agent/` | `integrate-elk.md` ✓ | `deploy-elk.md` ✓ | `indexing`, `search`, `caption-storage`, `dashboard`, `kafka-ingestion`, `redis-ingestion` |
| DS-SOP | `skills/vss-deploy-sop/` | `integrate-ds-sop.md` ✓ *(contract + **co-located** `component_services`/env overrides in its § "build-vision-agent machinery" — no separate patch file)* | `deploy-ds-sop.md` ✓ *(custom DeepStream SOP service; image `ds-sop:1.0.0` built locally — occupies the RT-VLM perception slot)* | `sop-detection`, `sop-compliance`, `action-detection`, `vlm`, `vision-language`, `streaming-inference` |

> **Note on ELK's location:** unlike RT-VLM, RT-CV, or VIOS — which are NVIDIA-built RTVI microservices owned by per-service teams — ELK is a third-party open-source stack (Elastic) used as VSS foundational infrastructure. Its reference files therefore live **co-located with the orchestrator skill** (`skills/vss-build-vision-agent/references/`) rather than in a sibling `skills/elk/` folder. This is the convention for foundational/infra components that the skill itself effectively owns; per-service NVIDIA microservices follow the canonical `skills/<service>/references/` pattern.

> **NvStreamer is NOT a catalog microservice.** `vss-vios-nvstreamer` (NvStreamer, `ADAPTOR=streamer`) is a **validation-harness component** the skill adds to exercise a deployment's live/streaming RTSP path when no real external camera/RTSP URL is supplied — it replaces the legacy `mediamtx + ffmpeg` dummy-stream sidecar. It is **NOT** a user-selectable ingestion microservice, **NOT** a `sensor_topology` variant, and is **NOT** declared in any `integrate-*.md` `component_services:` block (do not add it to `integrate-vios-service.md`'s block or capability-tag tables). It has no `integrate-/deploy-` pair files and is not tag-matched in Step 1. The skill emits it directly in Step 6 per `references/validation-harness.md` (which also documents the inclusion rule and the NvStreamer → VIOS → RT-VLM smoke sequence); its REST surface is documented read-only in `skills/vss-manage-video-io-storage/references/nvstreamer-api-reference.md`.

## Capability Tag Glossary

Tags used to match user prompts to microservices. Keep tags consistent across catalog entries — if a user prompt asks for "dense captioning", every microservice that satisfies that capability must carry the `dense-captioning` tag.

| Tag | Meaning | Services that carry it |
|---|---|---|
| `video-storage` | Persistent storage and retrieval of video clips | VIOS |
| `rtsp-ingestion` | Accepts RTSP streams as input | VIOS, RT-VLM |
| `video-upload` | Accepts video file uploads via REST | VIOS, RT-VLM |
| `clip-extraction` | Extracts time-bounded clips from recorded video | VIOS |
| `snapshot` | Returns single-frame snapshots from live or recorded streams | VIOS |
| `sensor-management` | Adds, lists, removes camera sensors / streams | VIOS |
| `dense-captioning` | Generates per-chunk natural-language descriptions of video | RT-VLM |
| `vlm` | Runs a vision-language model | RT-VLM |
| `vision-language` | Synonym for `vlm` | RT-VLM |
| `streaming-inference` | Processes live RTSP streams continuously | RT-VLM |
| `on-demand-inference` | Processes uploaded video files on request | RT-VLM |
| `alert-detection` | Emits structured alerts/incidents alongside captions | RT-VLM |
| `sop-detection` | Monitors a procedural task and emits per-chunk SOP step records | DS-SOP |
| `sop-compliance` | Flags missing / mis-ordered / cycle-complete SOP steps | DS-SOP |
| `action-detection` | Temporal action segmentation of video (DDM-Net) | DS-SOP |
| `indexing` | Indexes structured records for query | ELK (Elasticsearch) |
| `search` | Full-text and structured search over indexed records | ELK (Elasticsearch) |
| `caption-storage` | Persistent storage of caption / metadata records | ELK (Elasticsearch) |
| `dashboard` | Visual dashboards over indexed data | ELK (Kibana) |
| `kafka-ingestion` | Consumes Kafka topics and writes to a sink | ELK (Logstash) |
| `redis-ingestion` | Consumes Redis streams and writes to a sink | ELK (Logstash) |
| `alert-verification` | Verifies candidate alerts/incidents with a VLM before they are surfaced | Alert Microservice (`alert-bridge`) |
| `vlm-verification` | VLM-as-verifier: clip + prompt → confirmed/rejected verdict | Alert Microservice (`alert-bridge`) |
| `clip-retrieval` | Retrieves a time-bounded clip from VST/VIOS for an event | Alert Microservice (`alert-bridge`), VIOS |
| `incident-alerting` | Produces verified incident/alert records to a sink (ES / Kafka) | Alert Microservice (`alert-bridge`) |
| `message-broker-alerts` | Consumes candidate events from, and/or publishes verified alerts to, the Kafka message broker | Alert Microservice (`alert-bridge`) |
| `real-time-alerts` | Continuous VLM processing of stream chunks to trigger alerts (no upstream CV detector) | Alert Microservice (`alert-bridge`, `alert_source=vlm-realtime`) + RT-VLM |
| `false-positive-reduction` | VLM clip review to confirm/reject upstream detections | Alert Microservice (`alert-bridge`) |
| `ppe-compliance` | PPE-compliance verification (hard hats, safety vests) | Alert Microservice (`cv-verification`) |
| `restricted-area-monitoring` | Restricted-area / zone-entry alerting | Alert Microservice (`cv-verification`) |

> **Alert Microservice capability tags.** The `alert-bridge` microservice (the **Alert Microservice**, formerly "Alert Verification" — deploy identifiers `vss-alert-verification` / `vss-alert-bridge` unchanged) carries `alert-verification`, `vlm-verification`, `clip-retrieval`, `incident-alerting`, `message-broker-alerts`, `false-positive-reduction`, and reuses `alert-detection`; with `alert_source=vlm-realtime` it also satisfies `real-time-alerts`. Use-case tags `ppe-compliance` / `restricted-area-monitoring` map to the `cv-verification` **Alert Verification** approach. Its `component_services` block and the two-approach `alert_source` variant (`cv-verification` = **Alert Verification** approach / lower GPU; `vlm-realtime` = **Real-Time Alerts** approach / higher GPU) live in `references/patch-alerts.md`. Prompts like "verify alerts", "given a stream, retrieve clips, post verified alerts to the message broker", "reduce false positives on CV detections", or "PPE compliance" map here. The full official "what's being deployed" set (RTVI CV + Behavior Analytics + Alert Microservice + RT-VLM + VIOS + NVStreamer + ELK + VSS Agent + Nemotron LLM NIM + Phoenix) is composed by unioning this microservice with RT-CV, Behavior Analytics, RT-VLM, VIOS, ELK, and the agent/LLM-NIM entries.

When you add a new tag, list it here with the services that carry it.
