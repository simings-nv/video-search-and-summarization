# NVIDIA VSS Agent

AI-powered video search, summarization, and incident analysis agent built on
[NVIDIA AIQ Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/agent-toolkit/latest/index.html).

For deployment instructions (Docker Compose, Helm, cloud), refer to the
[repository root](../../README.md) and [`deploy/docker/`](../../deploy/docker/).

## Overview

VSS Agent provides composable tools and agents for video understanding:

- **Video Search & Summarization** — natural language search across video streams
- **Incident Analysis** — automated investigation and report generation
- **Video Understanding** — frame-level analysis with Vision Language Models
- **Video Analytics** — metadata, behavior, and event queries

## Project Structure

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `src/vss_agents/` | Core package: tools, agents, APIs, embeddings, evaluators |
| `tests/unit_test/` | Unit tests (mirrors source tree) |
| `stubs/` | Mypy type stubs for third-party libraries |
| `docker/` | Dockerfile and build scripts |
| `3rdparty/` | Third-party source (FFmpeg, included for LGPL compliance) |

## Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.13
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager

## Installation

Commands in **Installation**, **Quick Start**, **Testing**, and **Contributing** assume your shell is in `services/agent/` (this directory). From the repository root:

```bash
cd services/agent
```

Install system libraries required for PDF generation:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev pkg-config python3-dev
```

Install `uv` and create the virtual environment. If Python 3.13 is not present on the system,
`uv` downloads it automatically:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv venv --python 3.13
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Docker

```bash
cd .. # Be at services/ (Docker build context; Dockerfile COPY paths use agent/)
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -f agent/docker/Dockerfile -t vss-agent:latest --load .
cd agent  # back to services/agent/ for Quick Start and local development below
```

## Quick Start

The instructions below use the **dev-profile-base** profile as an example.
The same pattern applies to other profiles (search, alerts, LVS) — substitute the
corresponding `.env` and `config.yml` from
[`deploy/docker/developer-profiles/`](../../deploy/docker/developer-profiles/).
See [Configuration](#configuration) for the full list of profiles.

### 1. Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env_file` that points to the profile's `.env` so the agent auto-loads
environment variables on startup (one-time per profile):

```bash
echo "../../deploy/docker/developer-profiles/dev-profile-base/.env" > .env_file
```

Then source the same `.env` in your shell and override the placeholders.
`set -a` auto-exports every variable so child processes inherit them.
Because `HOST_IP` and `LLM/VLM_BASE_URL` are set **after** sourcing, every
variable the `.env` derived from them (VST URLs, Phoenix, reports URL, …)
must be re-evaluated — that is what the remaining lines do.

```bash
set -a
source ../../deploy/docker/developer-profiles/dev-profile-base/.env

HOST_IP=<YOUR_HOST_IP>                 # placeholder in .env
LLM_BASE_URL=http://${HOST_IP}:${LLM_PORT}   # empty in .env
VLM_BASE_URL=http://${HOST_IP}:${VLM_PORT}   # empty in .env
EXTERNAL_IP=${HOST_IP}                 # not in .env, used by config
INTERNAL_IP=${HOST_IP}                 # not in .env, used by config

# re-evaluate vars that were derived from the placeholder HOST_IP / empty URLs
EXTERNALLY_ACCESSIBLE_IP=${HOST_IP}
VST_INTERNAL_URL=http://${HOST_IP}:${VST_PORT}
VST_EXTERNAL_URL=http://${EXTERNALLY_ACCESSIBLE_IP}:${VST_PORT}
VSS_AGENT_REPORTS_BASE_URL=http://${EXTERNALLY_ACCESSIBLE_IP}:${VSS_AGENT_PORT}/static/
PHOENIX_ENDPOINT=http://${HOST_IP}:6006
EVAL_LLM_JUDGE_BASE_URL=${LLM_BASE_URL}
set +a
```

### 2. Start the Agent

```bash
nat serve \
  --config_file ../../deploy/docker/developer-profiles/dev-profile-base/vss-agent/configs/config.yml \
  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

On success you will see:

```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### 3. Verify

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

## Usage

Start the agent server:

```bash
nat serve --config_file <config>.yaml --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Configuration

Agent behavior is defined in YAML config files with four top-level sections:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `general` | Front-end type (FastAPI), CORS, telemetry, object stores |
| `functions` | Tool and sub-agent definitions (video understanding, VST, reports, …) |
| `llms` | LLM / VLM connection profiles (NIM, OpenAI, vLLM, …) |
| `workflow` | Orchestration — which LLM drives the agent, which tools are available, system prompt |

Config values support `${ENV_VAR}` substitution with optional defaults (`${VAR:-default}`).

Ready-to-use configurations are provided under
[`deploy/docker/developer-profiles/`](../../deploy/docker/developer-profiles/):

| Profile | Path | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Base | [`dev-profile-base/.../config.yml`](../../deploy/docker/developer-profiles/dev-profile-base/vss-agent/configs/config.yml) | Video understanding and report generation |
| Search | [`dev-profile-search/.../config.yml`](../../deploy/docker/developer-profiles/dev-profile-search/vss-agent/configs/config.yml) | Search and RAG workflow |
| LVS | [`dev-profile-lvs/.../config.yml`](../../deploy/docker/developer-profiles/dev-profile-lvs/vss-agent/configs/config.yml) | LVS video understanding |
| Alerts | [`dev-profile-alerts/.../config.yml`](../../deploy/docker/developer-profiles/dev-profile-alerts/vss-agent/configs/config.yml) | Incident analysis and alerting |

Each profile has a companion `.env` file in the same directory with all deployment variables
pre-configured.

### Environment Variables

The table below lists every variable referenced by the agent config files.
Variables marked **required** must be set before `nat serve`; the rest have sensible defaults
or are only needed for specific features.

| `EVAL_LLM_JUDGE_NAME` | no | same as `LLM_NAME` | Model used for evaluation judge |
| `EVAL_LLM_JUDGE_BASE_URL` | no | same as `LLM_BASE_URL` | Endpoint for evaluation judge |
| `NGC_CLI_API_KEY` | cond. | — | Required when `LLM_MODE` / `VLM_MODE` is `local` or `local_shared` (Docker Compose) |
| `NVIDIA_API_KEY` | cond. | — | Required for build.nvidia.com remote endpoints |
| `INSTALL_PROPRIETARY_CODECS` | no | `true` in the Compose/Helm deployments (the bare image installs nothing when the variable is unset) | Install OpenCV/FFmpeg at container startup to enable video decoding (see [Proprietary multimedia codecs](#proprietary-multimedia-codecs)) |

## Proprietary multimedia codecs

The pre-built VSS Agent container image **does not bundle `opencv-python-headless`**.
That wheel ships FFmpeg libraries that contain **patent-encumbered codecs** (H.264, H.265,
and variants), which NVIDIA cannot redistribute. Following the VST team's approach, **all
FFmpeg/codec libraries are removed while building the container** (`libav*`, `libswscale`,
`libswresample`, `libpostproc`, `libx264/5`, ...), and an installation script reinstalls
them at runtime only when the operator opts in. A build-time guard in the Dockerfile and a
CI job (`.github/scripts/check_no_patented_codecs.py`) fail the build if any such library
leaks into the image. Tools that decode video (video understanding/captioning, frame
timestamp, S3 picture URL) therefore fail with a clear error in the default image and
require opting in to the proprietary codecs.

Video decoding is **enabled by default** in the Docker Compose and Helm deployments
(`INSTALL_PROPRIETARY_CODECS=true`). At container startup the agent downloads
`opencv-python-headless` **from PyPI onto your own machine** (never from an NVIDIA source) and
adds it to the runtime path. By leaving this enabled you are obtaining and using
patent-encumbered codecs and are responsible for any associated licensing. Set
`INSTALL_PROPRIETARY_CODECS=false` to keep them off (the bare image, with the variable unset,
also installs nothing).

```bash
# Docker Compose — opt out of the codec download
INSTALL_PROPRIETARY_CODECS=false docker compose ... up
```

Notes:

- The image itself never bundles anything patent-encumbered; the Compose/Helm deployments
  default `INSTALL_PROPRIETARY_CODECS=true`, so codecs are downloaded at startup unless you set
  it to `false`.
- The download (~45–90 MB) happens once per container and is cached under `/vss-agent/.codecs`
  (override with `VSS_PROPRIETARY_CODECS_DIR`). A `.installed` marker skips re-download on restart.
- **Air-gapped deployments:** pre-download the matching wheel and point
  `VSS_PROPRIETARY_CODECS_WHEEL` at it to install without network access.
- If the install fails (e.g. no network), the agent still starts; only video-decoding
  features are unavailable.
- On GPU deployments, hardware decode via PyNvVideoCodec/NVDEC is the codec-royalty-covered
  alternative and does not require this opt-in.
