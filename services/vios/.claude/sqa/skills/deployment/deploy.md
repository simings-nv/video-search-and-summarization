# Skill: Deploy VIOS Stack

Deploy VIOS and NVStreamer services using the one-click Docker Compose script.

---

## Prerequisites

Run these checks before deploying. Stop immediately if any fail — do not attempt the deployment script.

```bash
# 1. Docker daemon accessible (user must be in docker group)
docker ps
# If this fails with permission denied → STOP. Tell the user:
#   "Add your user to the docker group and re-login:
#    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker"

# 2. Docker and Compose versions
docker --version && docker compose version

# 3. NVIDIA container runtime
docker info 2>/dev/null | grep -i nvidia

# 4. Ports free
ss -tlnp | grep -E "30888|31000|31001|31002|31003|31004"
# Expected: no output (ports are free)
```

If `docker ps` fails, stop and give the user the docker group command — do not proceed further.

## Step 1 — Determine deployment mode

Infer the target from user context or the invoking agent's workflow. Do not prompt unless genuinely ambiguous.

| Mode | Target flag | Command |
|---|---|---|
| Stream-processor (default) | — | nvstreamer step + `deploy --force` (two steps — see Step 2) |
| NVStreamer only | `nvstreamer` | `deploy --target nvstreamer --force` |
| Full stack (stream-processor + NVStreamer) | `all` | `deploy --target all --force` |
| With monitoring | — | add `--with-monitoring` |

---

## Step 1b — Detect image tags (MANDATORY — do this before every deploy)

`compose.env` contains pinned versioned tags. `build.sh` always produces `latest` tagged images and does NOT update `compose.env`. You must determine the correct tag flags — otherwise the deploy will silently use stale registry images.

**If this deploy follows a build in the current session:** use the BUILD_TAG established in `skills/build/build-containers.md` Step 6 directly. Pass `--all-tag <BUILD_TAG> --nvstreamer-tag <BUILD_TAG>` to the deploy command. Skip the probe below.

**If deploying standalone (no build done in this session):** probe for recent local images:

```bash
# Check if :latest images were built within the last 24 hours
docker images --format "{{.Repository}}:{{.Tag}}\t{{.CreatedAt}}" \
  | grep -E "vst-streamprocessing:latest|nvstreamer:latest"
```

Then decide:

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| `nvstreamer:latest` or `vst-streamprocessing:latest` created within last 24 hours | **Ask the user:** "I found a locally built `latest` image (built at `<timestamp>`). Do you want to deploy using that instead of the pinned registry tag?" |
| User says yes | Use `--nvstreamer-tag latest` / `--all-tag latest` for whichever images are recent |
| User says no, or no recent `:latest` found | Proceed without tag flags — compose.env pinned tags will be used |

Do not add `--pull-always` — that pulls from the registry and discards the local build.

---

## Step 2 — Run the deployment script

```bash
cd <PROJECT_ROOT>/services/vios/deployment/stream-processing
```

### Step 2a — Classify the deploy intent

NVStreamer and the VIOS adaptor are **independent**. Decide what to deploy by reading the user's prompt for explicit NVStreamer intent first; only fall back to the adaptor heuristic if the prompt is silent.

| Pattern in the user's prompt | Decision | Next step |
|---|---|---|
| Mentions `nvstreamer` together with any of `+`, `&`, `and`, `with`, `alongside`, `plus` — e.g. *"deploy vios in milestone adaptor & deploy nvstreamer"*, *"deploy vios + nvstreamer"*, *"deploy vios and nvstreamer"* | **Always deploy NVStreamer too**, regardless of adaptor. | Skip the probe. Jump to Step 2d and run BOTH commands (or use `deploy --target all --force` if the user explicitly says "full stack" / "everything"). |
| Contains any of: `without nvstreamer`, `skip nvstreamer`, `no nvstreamer`, `rtsp from elsewhere`, `external rtsp` | **Never deploy NVStreamer.** | Skip the probe. Jump to Step 2d and run ONLY the VIOS command. Log: *"User opted out of NVStreamer."* |
| Bare `deploy vios` / `deploy vst` / `deploy` with no NVStreamer mention | **Silent — use the adaptor heuristic.** | Proceed to Step 2b. |
| `deploy nvstreamer` / `deploy the streamer` (NVStreamer only, no VIOS) | NVStreamer-only target | Skip 2b/2c. Run: `deploy --target nvstreamer --force`. |
| `full stack` / `everything` / `deploy both` (matches "full stack" wording AND user is OK with the one-command form) | `--target all` | Skip 2b/2c. Run: `deploy --target all --force`. |

> **Important:** the adaptor heuristic in Steps 2b/2c is a fallback for the silent case. **It does NOT override** an explicit user request. If the user said *"deploy vios in milestone adaptor & deploy nvstreamer"*, you deploy NVStreamer too — even though the milestone adaptor wouldn't normally need it. NVStreamer can always run as an additional RTSP source.

### Step 2b — Adaptor heuristic (default behavior, only when user is silent on NVStreamer)

Read the adaptor from compose.env:

```bash
ENV_FILE=docker-compose/compose.env
VST_ADAPTOR=$(grep -E '^VST_ADAPTOR=' "$ENV_FILE" | cut -d= -f2)
NGINX_MODE=$(grep -E '^NGINX_MODE=' "$ENV_FILE" | cut -d= -f2)
echo "Adaptor: ${VST_ADAPTOR:-vst_rtsp}  NGINX_MODE: ${NGINX_MODE:-vst}"
```

Branch:

- `VST_ADAPTOR ∈ {vst_rtsp, streamer}` (or unset) → this adaptor typically pairs with NVStreamer for RTSP. **Proceed to Step 2c** (probe NVStreamer state).
- `VST_ADAPTOR ∈ {onvif, remote, native, milestone_onvif, milestone_soap, test_vms}` → RTSP comes from a camera / VMS / mock by default. **Don't deploy NVStreamer**, but announce the decision clearly so the user can correct you:
  > *"Detected `VST_ADAPTOR=<value>` (`NGINX_MODE=<value>`). RTSP source is external — deploying VIOS only. If you also want NVStreamer running as an additional RTSP source, say `+ nvstreamer` and I'll re-run."*

  Then jump to Step 2d and run ONLY the VIOS command.

**If `VST_ADAPTOR` is an mms-type adaptor (`milestone_onvif`, `milestone_soap`), run the credentials pre-flight in `skills/deployment/adaptor-mode.md` Step 2.5 BEFORE invoking the deploy command.** Missing `ip`/`user`/`password` in `adaptor_config.json` cause silent runtime failures. The skill covers prompt-parsing, the ask-the-user phrasing, the dry-run diff, the write, and the credentials-hygiene reminder.

For other details on the adaptor↔NGINX_MODE↔JSON consistency and post-deploy verification, see `skills/deployment/adaptor-mode.md`.

### Step 2c — NVStreamer state probe (only reached for vst_rtsp / streamer adaptors when user is silent)

```bash
NVS_HEALTHY=$(docker ps --filter "name=nvstreamer-1" --filter "health=healthy" --format "{{.Names}}")
```

Branch on the result:

- **`NVS_HEALTHY` is `nvstreamer-1`** → NVStreamer is already up and healthy. **Skip the nvstreamer step.** Log: *"Reusing existing NVStreamer (nvstreamer-1, up <duration>). Deploying VIOS only."* Jump to Step 2d (VIOS-only command).
- **`NVS_HEALTHY` is empty** (not running, or unhealthy) → **ask the user once** before deploying it:
  > *"VIOS adaptor is `<VST_ADAPTOR>` which usually pairs with NVStreamer for RTSP. NVStreamer isn't running. Deploy it alongside (recommended for local dev), or skip if RTSP comes from elsewhere (external server / a pre-populated `NVS_VIDEO_DIR`)?"*
  - User confirms → run BOTH commands in Step 2d (nvstreamer first, then VIOS).
  - User declines → run ONLY the VIOS command from Step 2d, and warn in the response: *"VIOS deployed; sensors will register but will not receive frames until a working RTSP source is configured."*

### Step 2d — Commands

```bash
# (only if Step 2c ask was confirmed OR explicit nvstreamer target)
# Add --nvstreamer-tag <BUILD_TAG> if deploying a locally built NVStreamer (see Step 1b)
python3 oneclick_dc_deployment.py deploy --target nvstreamer --force

# Default VIOS deploy
# Add --all-tag <BUILD_TAG> if deploying locally built VIOS images (see Step 1b)
python3 oneclick_dc_deployment.py deploy --force
```

**Full stack (`--target all`)** — single command, do NOT add an nvstreamer step before this; the script handles NVStreamer internally:
```bash
# Add --all-tag <BUILD_TAG> --nvstreamer-tag <BUILD_TAG> if deploying locally built images (see Step 1b)
python3 oneclick_dc_deployment.py deploy --target all --force
```

**NVStreamer only:**
```bash
# Add --nvstreamer-tag <BUILD_TAG> if deploying a locally built NVStreamer (see Step 1b)
python3 oneclick_dc_deployment.py deploy --target nvstreamer --force
```

Additional flags for the **VIOS deploy command only** (do not append to the nvstreamer step):
```bash
--with-monitoring   # Grafana/Prometheus
--skip-sysctl       # Skip host network-buffer (sysctl) tuning. Pass this for
                    # agent/CI runs without passwordless sudo. The script also
                    # auto-skips with a warning if stdin is non-TTY and sudo
                    # would prompt, but this flag is clearer in the log.
```

### Sysctl pre-flight (run BEFORE the VIOS deploy command)

The deploy script tunes four kernel network-buffer sysctls (`net.core.rmem_max`, `net.core.wmem_max`, `net.ipv4.tcp_rmem`, `net.ipv4.tcp_wmem`) to support high-throughput streaming. If the host already has these at the target values, the script no-ops. Otherwise it invokes `sudo sysctl -w …` — which **prompts for a password unless sudo is passwordless**.

Run the script's built-in probe — it returns a single machine-parseable line and **never invokes sudo** (only `sudo -n true`, which exits cleanly either way):

```bash
python3 oneclick_dc_deployment.py preflight-sysctl
# → SYSCTL_PREFLIGHT status=<S> rmem_max=… wmem_max=… tcp_rmem="…" tcp_wmem="…" rmem_max_target=… tcp_target="…" sudo=<S>
```

Extract `status` and branch:

```bash
STATUS=$(python3 oneclick_dc_deployment.py preflight-sysctl | grep -oE 'status=[a-z_]+' | cut -d= -f2)
```

- `status=skip` → all four sysctls already meet target; append `--skip-sysctl` to silence the info log (script would no-op anyway).
- `status=passwordless` → tuning is needed AND `sudo -n` works; run deploy normally — sudo passes through silently.
- `status=needs_password` AND **interactive user available** → ask the user *"Deploy will tune host network buffers (rmem_max → 2 MB, etc.); enter sudo password, or pass --skip-sysctl to skip (throughput may be lower)?"* then proceed accordingly.
- `status=needs_password` AND **non-interactive (you can't surface a prompt)** → append `--skip-sysctl` to avoid hanging. The script will also auto-skip with a warning, but the explicit flag is clearer in the deploy log.

> **Why this command (vs. inline `sysctl`/`sudo -n` shell):** the script command is static-analyzable (no `$(…)`, no `if`, no `sudo -n` invocation at the agent layer), so coding agents auto-allowlist it instead of asking the user to approve every pre-flight run.

---

## Step 3 — Resolve BASE_URL from deployment output

The script prints the detected host IP. Capture it and set BASE_URL:
```
BASE_URL = http://<detected-host-ip>:30888
```

If the script output does not show the IP, detect it:
```bash
hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'
```

Pass BASE_URL to any subsequent skill (tests, UI browsing).

---

## Step 4 — Verify deployment health

```bash
# Check all containers are running
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}" | grep -E "vios|nvstreamer|redis"

# Check VIOS API health (health endpoint is localhost-only, not accessible via external IP)
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:30888/api/health
# Expected: 200
```

If health check returns non-200 or containers show `Restarting` status, go to `guides/troubleshooting.md`.

---

## Step 4b — Sync config.json with resolved BASE_URL

Update `test/bdd_tests/config.json` so the MCP URL derivation uses the correct host. The file defaults to `localhost:30888` which causes all MCP gateway tests to fail.

```bash
python3 - <<EOF
import json, sys
config_path = "<PROJECT_ROOT>/test/bdd_tests/config.json"
base_url = "<BASE_URL>"
with open(config_path) as f:
    config = json.load(f)
config["api"]["base_url"] = base_url
with open(config_path, "w") as f:
    json.dump(config, f, indent=2)
print(f"config.json updated: api.base_url = {base_url}")
EOF
```

---

## Step 5 — Report outcome

Report to the user:
- Which containers are running and their status
- Resolved BASE_URL
- VIOS UI: `<BASE_URL>/vios/#/dashboard`
- Any warnings from the deployment script output

---

## Sample Video Files

Deployments now start **without** any pre-seeded videos -- the sample clips are
no longer shipped under `tools/data/` (they are baked into the BDD test image
and used only by the BDD suite). NVStreamer comes up with no streams.

If a deployment needs a video source:

- **Ask the user to point to a directory that contains valid video files**
  (MP4/MKV/TS carrying H.264 or H.265). Do not assume `tools/data/` exists.
- Upload those files to NVStreamer (`PUT /vst/api/v1/storage/file/<name>`), then
  run a sensor scan from the VST UI (or `POST /vst/api/v1/sensor/scan`) so VIOS
  imports the RTSP streams.

## Image Tag Flags Reference

| Flag | Controls |
|---|---|
| `--all-tag <TAG>` | Stream-processor + sensor images |
| `--streamprocessor-tag <TAG>` | Stream-processor module |
| `--sensor-tag <TAG>` | Sensor module |
| `--nvstreamer-tag <TAG>` | NVStreamer |
| `--streamprocessor-image <REF>` | Full stream-processor image ref (pair with `--streamprocessor-tag`) |
| `--sensor-image <REF>` | Full sensor image ref (pair with `--sensor-tag`) |
| `--image-registry <REG>` | Swap only the registry/org prefix on stream-processor + sensor images |
| `--nvstreamer-image <REPO>` | Swap the NVStreamer image repository |

If no tag flags are given, the script uses whatever is configured in the compose files.
