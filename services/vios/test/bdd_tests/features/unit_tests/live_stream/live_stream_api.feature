  Validate that the Live Stream Service REST APIs respond correctly.
  WebRTC signaling endpoints are excluded as they require a full WebRTC handshake.

  # Regression for NVBug 6167266: live stream objects must surface sensor tags
  Scenario: Live stream objects include the tags assigned to their sensor
    Given the VST live stream API is accessible
    And an RTSP sensor tagged with a unique tag has been added
    When I request the list of live streams and wait for the tagged sensor
    Then the response status is 200
    And every live stream for the tagged sensor includes a tags field matching the sensor tag
