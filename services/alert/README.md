# Alerts Microservice

**A modular, configuration-driven Alerts microservice for the Video Search and
Summarization (VSS) blueprint — VLM-based alert verification, realtime alert
generation, and on-demand clip verification.**

## Overview

The Alerts Microservice processes alerts and incidents produced by the VSS pipeline and
uses a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to confirm, classify, and enrich them. It
supports three modes:

- **Alert verification** (primary) — alerts generated upstream by real-time CV
  detection and behavior analytics are reviewed by a VLM to reduce false
  positives. For each alert, the service resolves the corresponding video
  segment from the video service using the sensor ID and alert timestamps,
  renders an alert-type-specific prompt, and sends the clip to a VLM backend
  over an OpenAI-compatible API. It returns a structured verdict (confirmed /
  rejected / unverified) with a reasoning trace.
- **Realtime alerts** — register realtime alert rules that run continuous VLM
  processing over input streams (including "always-on" refinement); generated
  alerts are published over Kafka.
- **On-demand verification** — third-party CV applications can request VLM
  verification of a stored video snippet.

Alerts use the NvSchema `nv.Incident` / `nv.Behavior` formats (JSON or
Protobuf) and are ingested over **Kafka** or the **HTTP API**. Verified results
are persisted to **Elasticsearch** and can optionally be re-published to Kafka.
The VLM backend is pluggable — an OpenAI-compatible endpoint such as an NVIDIA
VLM NIM (e.g. Cosmos Reason), the RTVI VLM microservice, or a remote model
endpoint.

> **No Redis required.** Earlier releases used Redis for dedup/filter
> caching and alert-config storage. That dependency has been removed:
> deduplication, the end-time delta filter and the (optional) rate limit
> run as **in-process** state per consumer, while confirmed-verdict
> protection and alert-type configs are stored in **Elasticsearch**.
> Because `mdx-incidents` is partitioned by `sensorId`, every event for a
> dedup cohort is routed to the same consumer, so no cross-pod
> coordination — and therefore no shared cache — is needed. Multi-replica
> deployments work unchanged: each pod owns its Kafka partitions and keeps
> its own in-process state; on restart/rebalance the pod taking over
> rebuilds state from new events (verdict protection survives via ES).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- A reachable OpenAI-compatible **VLM backend** (configured in `config.yaml`)
- **Elasticsearch** (durable storage for alert configs + confirmed-verdict protection)
- Depending on your source/sink choice: **Kafka** and/or **Elasticsearch**
- No **Redis** instance is required.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or build/run with Docker (see Quick Start).

## Quick Start

1. **Configure** — edit `config.yaml`: set the VLM `base_url`/`model`, the
   Kafka/Elasticsearch endpoints, and the sink type. Optionally override
   request defaults in `alert_request_defaults.yaml` (or point
   `ALERT_AGENT_DEFAULTS_FILE` at a custom file). Dedup / end-time-delta /
   verdict-protection tuning lives under `alert_agent.event_filters`.

2. **Start the stack** (Kafka source/sink is the default; no Redis):

   ```bash
   docker compose -f deploy_docker-compose.yml up -d

   # or with a custom config file
   ALERT_BRIDGE_CONFIG_FILE=./your-config.yaml docker compose -f deploy_docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

3. **Verify** — the service is available at:
   - Health: `http://localhost:9080/health`
   - API docs (Swagger): `http://localhost:9080/docs`
   - OpenAPI spec: `http://localhost:9080/openapi.json`
   - WebSocket: `ws://localhost:9080/ws`

To run the verification pipeline directly (without Docker):

```bash
python enhance_alert_with_vlm.py --config config.yaml
```

## Configuration

`config.yaml` controls the runtime. Key sections:

- **`vlm`** — `base_url` (OpenAI-compatible VLM endpoint), `model`, generation params.
- **source / sink** — `kafka` (ingestion) and `elasticsearch`/`kafka` (output sink).
- **persistence / elastic** — Elasticsearch host for durable storage.

Per-alert-type verification prompts and VLM parameters are seeded from
`alert_type_config.json` and stored in **Elasticsearch** (index
`ab-alert_configs`). They can be managed at runtime via the Verification
Config API (`POST/PUT/GET /api/v1/verification/config[/{alert_type}]`); the
pipeline reads through to Elasticsearch on each VLM call (an in-process cache
is read-through by default), so updates apply without a restart. Set
`persistence.cache_ttl_seconds > 0` to cache config reads at the cost of
bounded cross-process staleness.

## Usage

Submit an alert over the REST API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9080/api/v1/alerts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @test/protobuf/test_data/sample_alert.json
```

Enriched results are persisted and broadcast over the WebSocket endpoint.

## Testing

Unit tests run with `pytest`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```

For functional and end-to-end testing against local simulators (Kafka +
Elasticsearch, sending sample payloads, verifying responses), see
[`test/TEST_README.md`](test/TEST_README.md).
