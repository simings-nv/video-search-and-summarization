        primary: Durable store (ES). Must be reachable — call ``health()``
            upstream to fail-fast before invoking hydration.
        cache: Hot-path cache (in-process). Individual write failures here
            are non-fatal; they are logged but do not abort hydration.
        memory: Mutable dict shared with the cached store. Cleared and
