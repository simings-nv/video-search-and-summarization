"""Abstract interface for alert-config storage backends.

Concrete implementations live in sibling modules:

- ``memory_store.InMemoryAlertConfigStore`` — in-process store; used as the
  hot-path cache and as the standalone store when persistence is disabled.
- ``es_store.ESAlertConfigStore`` — Elasticsearch durable store (source of truth).
- ``cached_store.CachedAlertConfigStore`` — write-through / read-through
  composite combining the ES primary with the in-process cache.

Keeping the interface separate lets ``AlertConfigService`` depend on the
contract rather than any specific backend.
