class PersistenceStore(ABC):
    """Schema-agnostic persistence interface for durable document storage.

    Implementations must provide CRUD + list operations over a collection
    of JSON documents.  Each document is identified by a (collection, doc_id)
    pair where *collection* maps to the backend's native container (e.g. an
    Elasticsearch index) and *doc_id* is a caller-supplied unique key.

    The interface deliberately carries no knowledge of prompts, alert configs,
    or any other domain object — that concern lives in the layers above.

    Document id convention: every method that returns a stored document
    (``create`` / ``read`` / ``update`` / each item under ``list``) echoes
    the id as the ``"_id"`` key so callers can round-trip to subsequent
    ``update`` / ``delete`` calls without having to mirror the id into
    the document body.
