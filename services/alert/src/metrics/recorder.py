"""Module-level Prometheus recording helpers for the VLM verification pipeline.

This module owns all calls into the prometheus_client API so the rest of the
codebase does not have to know whether metrics are enabled. The functions are
pure module-level callables (no class, no ``self``) so they:

  * do not couple metric recording to ``AnomalyEnhancer`` construction;
  * can be reused from the realtime / REST surfaces without instantiating the
    orchestrator;
  * let unit tests import and exercise them directly without standing up the
    full pipeline.

When ``PROMETHEUS_METRICS_ENABLED`` is false every public entry point is a
cheap no-op (one flag check + early return), so callers do not need their
own ``if PROMETHEUS_ENABLED:`` guards.

# ── Startup label warmup (C15) ────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Prometheus scrapes landing between the HTTP-server bind and the first
# observation/increment see labelled counters as *absent* — not as zero.
# ``rate()`` and ``increase()`` treat absent series very differently from
# zero-valued series, so startup-window scrapes can produce spurious
# "metric disappeared" alerts until the first real event lands. Worse,
# some alerting rules (``absent_over_time``) would fire every time the
# process restarts.
#
# Eagerly calling ``.labels(value).inc(0)`` for every known label
# combination before the server binds turns "absent" into "present with
# value 0". Counters are monotonic so an ``inc(0)`` has no numerical
# effect on the cumulative value — it just materializes the series.

# Verdict labels matching the C8 allowlist. Kept in sync so any future
# edit to ``EVENTS_VERDICTS`` automatically warms the new labels too.

#   VLM taxonomy — the four ``raise e`` branches in
#   ``_process_single_message`` plus the legacy url/parse/unknown values.
#   ``no_prompt`` — alert type has no prompt configured (C10).
#   ``redis_unavailable`` — legacy label name (kept for metric-contract
#     back-compat); a backend failure during the confirmed-verdict skip
#     check (C25); covered by ``_classify_pre_processing_failure``.
