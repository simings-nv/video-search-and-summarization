#                      + <other early-exit skips>
#
# The first identity is complete: every pre-processing filter that drops
# a message increments ``EVENTS_DROPPED`` with the corresponding
# ``reason`` label, and every message that survives is counted in
# ``EVENTS_AFTER_DEDUP``.
#
# The second identity is **mostly** complete after C9: events that are
# skipped because a confirmed verdict already exists (verdict protection,
# ES-backed) are now counted in ``EVENTS_SKIPPED_CONFIRMED``. The one
# remaining gap is C10:
#   - Events whose alert type has no prompt configured — will be counted
#     via ``VERIFICATION_FAILURES{reason="no_prompt"}`` in a follow-up.

# Events dropped by batch-level filters BEFORE the per-event pipeline runs.
# This is the counter operators use to distinguish "event processed
# correctly" from "event silently discarded upstream" — critical for GT
# eval pipelines where a count-match false-positive (dropped events going
# unnoticed) is the single biggest correctness risk.

# reason values:
#   end_time_delta – event's ``end`` timestamp is outside the configured
#                    record-time window (too old or clock-skew future)

# These counters are structurally identical to the ones above but carry
# an extra ``sensorId`` label. They are populated ONLY when the opt-in
# config flag ``alert_agent.metrics.per_sensor_labels`` is true —
# otherwise they stay absent, costing the scrape target nothing.
#
# Rationale for keeping them separate (rather than adding a label to
# the existing metrics): Prometheus metric shape is fixed at
# construction time. Two-metric split lets small deployments opt into
# per-sensor detail without breaking any existing dashboard that
# queries the label-less aggregates, and lets large deployments stay
# safely below the ~10k-series-per-target guideline by leaving the
# opt-in off. ``sensorId`` is sanitized at the recorder boundary (see
# ``metrics.recorder._sanitize_sensor_id``) so pathological producer
# input cannot mint unbounded series.
#
# Per-sensor latency histograms use the same opt-in gate. They are defined
# above so Prometheus can expose them when observed, but the recorder only
# emits them when ``per_sensor_labels`` is enabled in config.
