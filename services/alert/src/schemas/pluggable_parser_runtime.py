"""Runtime helpers for the pluggable VLM-response parser path (Option B).

This module is the *single source of truth* for the shape that pluggable
parsers produce on the wire. Keeping these helpers in :mod:`models` (rather
than inside ``enhance_alert_with_vlm``) buys two architectural wins:

1. ``handlers.direct_media.DirectMediaHandler`` can import them at module
   load time instead of paying a lazy-import penalty on every VLM
   response — no more circular-import smell between orchestrator and
   Mode-3 handler.
2. ``schemas.base_response_parser`` keeps its narrow contract+loader role;
   merge/error side effects live next door but do not pollute it.

The helpers assume the Option B schema contract:

* Default verification path → emits ``info["reasoning"]`` via
  :class:`schemas.vlm_responses.VLMResponse`.
* Pluggable-parser path → emits ``info["vlm_response"]`` (JSON-serialized
  parser output) with ``info["verdict"] = ""``.

The two schemas are disjoint by construction: a given message either
runs through the default path or the pluggable path, never both.
